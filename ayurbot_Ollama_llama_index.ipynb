It pains me that I must write a disclaimer at the beginning of\\nthis book.

Heaven\\nforbid someone reads these words and claims to be adversely affected\\nby them, thus ensuring a barrage of lawsuits filed under the guise of\\nprotecting the unknowing victims who were stupid enough to read\\nthis and believe it! In reality, these lawyers are squashing the rights\\nof people, like myself, from freely expressing their ideas. So with a\\nfigurative gun to my head I write these words:\\nBefore you read this book you had better check with your medical\\ndoctor, your friends, your politicians, your priest, your rabbi, your\\npsychic, and anyone you feel is smarter than you, and see if you can\\nget permission to read what I have to say.\\nYou must know that everything I say in this book is simply my\\nopinion and that there are many people who violently disagree with\\nmy conclusions. If you do anything I recommend without the super-\\nvision of a licensed medical doctor, you do so at your own risk. The\\npublisher and the author, the distributors and bookstores, present\\nthis information for educational purposes only. I am not making an\\nattempt to prescribe any medical treatment, since under the laws of\\nthe United States only a licensed medical doctor (an MD) can do so.\\nHow sad!\\nSo this book is only my opinions, my thoughts, and my conclu-\\nsions.

The first\\nvariable is your willingness to learn. I believe that by you purchasing\\nthis book, spending your own money, and spending the time to read\\nthis book, that you, on a scale of one to ten, probably have a pretty high\\nwillingness to learn. However, the second variable will really determine\\njust how teachable you are. The second variable in the teachability\\nindex is what is your willingness to accept change. If you have a ten\\non willingness to learn, but a zero on willingness to accept change, ten\\ntimes zero is zero; therefore, your teachability index is nonexistent.\\nYou must have a high willingness to accept change if you are to fully\\ngrasp and understand these concepts and benefit from them. I sincerely\\nhope that you have a high teachability index.\\nAs you go through this book please consider another important\\nfactor on fully utilizing this information in your daily life.

I was\\ntwenty-one years old and had my whole life in front of me. I had to\\ndo something!\\nMonths earlier I had attended a lecture where I heard about a\\nHarvard medical doctor named Yiwen Y. Tang, founder of the Century\\nClinic in Reno, Nevada, who, during the Korean War, was a MASH\\nsurgeon. (Today the clinic is called Sierra Integrative Medical Center.)\\nThis MD had decided that standard medical procedures, drugs, and\\nsurgery were not the best way to cure and prevent diseases. He\\ninstead was using a diagnostic device developed in Germany by a Dr.\\nReinhold Voll called the Dermatron machine. Allegedly, in a matter\\nof minutes, it could diagnose medical problems in the body. When the\\ndiagnosis was complete, homeopathic remedies were given to correct\\nthe imbalances and reverse and cure the disease.\\nAt the time it sounded like hocus-pocus. The words homeostasis,\\nholistic healing, homeopathic remedies, acupuncture meridians, energy\\nfrequencies, imbalances, and the like were used in the lecture, replac-\\ning what was, to me, the standard vernacular of germs, bacteria, viruses,\\ndrugs, surgery, and genetics. Skeptical, yet open to new ideas, I flew to\\nReno, Nevada, to meet this great Dr. Tang. What did I have to lose?\\nUpon my arrival, the doctor asked me why I was there. I looked fit\\nand healthy, and being so young, he was slightly puzzled by my desire\\nfor diagnosis. Most of his patients were old and had severe medical\\nproblems. Wanting to see if this Dermatron machine was legitimate, I\\nsimply said, \"I feel great. I just want a basic checkup.\"\\nImmediately he tested me with his magic machine. Within two\\nminutes he had touched my heart meridian with the probe and the\\nmachine registered very low energy. The doctor looked at me, slightly\\nconcerned, and said, \"Son you have a heart problem.\" I was shocked\\nat how quickly the diagnosis came. Just as quickly he stated, \"Let me\\nfind out where it is.\"\\nHe began to touch other meridian points. When he got to the mitral\\nvalve, the machine again registered very little energy. He looked at me\\nand said matter-of-factly, \"You have a mitral valve prolapse.\"\\nNeedless to say, I was quite impressed. The expert medical doctors\\ntook days of diagnostic testing to determine that I had a severe mitral\\nvalve prolapse. This \"energy machine\" diagnosed the problem within\\nminutes.

The most amaz-\\ning part of this story is, after I received the natural treatment that was\\nforbidden in America, I went back to the medical doctors who originally\\ndiagnosed my heart problem and asked to be tested again. My request\\nwas met with indignation; I was told that being tested again was a waste\\nof time and money because it was impossible for the medical condition\\nto change in two months. Nevertheless, I demanded a readministering\\nof all the tests anyway. The doctors humored me and were stunned\\nwhen they found I no longer had a mitral valve prolapse.\\nI was so excited to share with them information about the treat-\\nment I had received which had cured my problem.

Imagine my shock when I was told that\\nthe treatment I received could not have cured my disease but, rather,\\nI must have been misdiagnosed in the first place and never had the\\nheart deformity to begin with. I could not believe my ears! These\\nmedical doctors would not accept the facts: I had a severe mitral valve\\nprolapseâthe pictures confirmed it; and now I do not have a mitral\\nvalve prolapseâthe pictures confirm it.\\nI began to think of all of the people that would come to these medi-\\ncal doctors and be told the bold-faced lie that their medical condition\\nwas incurable and could only be treated with drugs and surgery. It sick-\\nened me to know that the truth about natural cures would be hidden\\nfrom millions of patients.

Every decision a company makes is to\\nincrease profits.\\nCompanies, however, are run by people. People have two motiva-\\ntionsâfirst, to make more money for themselves personally; and,\\nsecond, to increase their power, prestige, or influence. Therefore,\\nthe individuals who run companies will always make decisions based\\non what can personally enrich themselves. Very few individuals are\\nconcerned about the good of mankind, the environment, or achieving\\nsome spiritual nirvana. To varying degrees, decisions are based on the\\nanswer to the question, \"What\\'s in it for me?\"\\nIn business, is everything always about the money? Yes. Throughout\\nthe history of big business, planned obsolescence has been standard\\noperating procedure. This is when a product is manufactured in such a\\nway so that it will wear out or need to be replaced. The product could\\nhave been made to last a very long time; but in order for the company\\nto ensure future profits, it knowingly manufactured an item that was\\ninherently flawed. Thus it planned for the product\\'s obsolescence, all\\nin the name of profit.\\nIn today\\'s business environment, companies only do things that\\neither increase sales, decrease the cost of the product, or guarantee a\\nhigher price for the product. A simplified example of this can be seen\\nwith restaurants that are located in airports. The restaurant has a\\nmonopoly, there is no competition. Since the restaurant knows it is not\\nrelying on repeat business, it does not have to give good-quality food,\\ngood service, or a fair price. Have you ever gotten a great meal with great\\nservice at a great price at an airport restaurant? I sure haven\\'t. Why?\\nBecause they don\\'t have to. Giving good service and a good product at\\na fair price will not increase profit at an airport restaurant because they\\nare not relying on repeat customers. Another example is outsourcing.\\nWhy are hundreds of companies laying off millions of American work-\\ners and outsourcing this work to people in other countries? Because\\nit\\'s cheaper! Remember, the corporate officers and directors of publicly\\ntraded companies have a legal responsibility to increase profits. If they\\ndon\\'t, they will lose their jobs. Big business will always make decisions\\nbased on profit, not what is good for the employees, what is good for the\\ncustomer, what is good for the environment, what is good for society, or\\nwhat is good for mankind.\\nLet\\'s look at the drug industry.

Making money becomes the most important thing in\\nthese people\\'s lives. Making money and doing whatever it takes to\\nmake more money becomes the chief motivation in virtually all their\\ndecisions and actions. If making more money means lying, stealing,\\ndefrauding, falsifying, or harming other people, it\\'s okay. If making\\nmore money means breaking the laws, destroying the environment,\\nor seeing other people suffer, it\\'s okay. Don\\'t believe me? Let me point\\nout a few examples.\\nDid you know there are thousands and thousands of millionaires,\\nmultimillionaires, and billionaires in prisons all around the world?\\nWhy are they in prison? Because even with their millions, they had\\nsuch greed that they were willing to break the law to make more\\nmoney. You may think these people are the exceptions. Consider this:\\nFor every drug dealer that was caught and is in prison, there are prob-\\nably one thousand drug dealers on the streets that were not caught! I\\ncan tell you firsthand that for every millionaire or corporate officer or\\ndirector that is in prison for breaking the law out of greed, there are\\nhundreds if not thousands of officers, directors, and wealthy stock-\\nholders who are defrauding the public motivated by personal greed. Do\\nyou know what the number one motive for murder is? Money! That\\'s\\nright, money. The love of money and greed are such strong motivators\\nthat they are the number one reason people kill other human beings. It\\nmost definitely is true: Greed, defined as the love of money, is indeed\\nthe root of all evil.\\nWe see it on TV with Enron and WorldCom and Martha Stewart.\\nIndividuals who have tens of millions of dollars in their bank accounts\\nand are so greedy they want more. They will lie and defraud, cheat\\nand effectively steal money from shareholders and employees for their\\nown personal gain. Their ethics have been thrown out the window.\\nThey\\'ve sold their soul to the devil. There are thousands of people\\nin every aspect of business and government that commit illegal acts\\nall because they want more money. It\\'s always all about the money.\\nJust watch reality TV! Do you know that the producers of most real-\\nity TV shows are hoping that the real people on these shows have\\ntheir lives ruined on national television? The producers make money\\nwith great ratings. If a person is physically hurt or has an emotion-\\nally traumatizing event happen, the ratings soar and the producers\\nmake more money.

That means that the officers and directors of virtually every\\npharmaceutical company have a legal responsibility to increase prof-\\nits. The only way they can increase profits is to sell more of what\\nthey sell and produce those products at a lower cost. Drug compa-\\nnies, therefore, have one goal, and that is to sell more drugs and\\nproduce those drugs at the cheapest possible cost. Think about that.\\nA drug company\\'s objective is not to cure disease. A drug company\\'s\\ngoal is to sell more drugs. You are their customer. They want you to\\nuse more drugs every single year. They want to produce those drugs\\nat the lowest possible cost and they want to do whatever they can\\nto make sure that they can sell those drugs at the highest possible\\nprice. That\\'s why there is a huge debate about people buying phar-\\nmaceutical drugs from other countries. The FDA makes up this silly\\nexcuse that a country like Canada doesn\\'t produce drugs under the\\nsame safety guidelines as America. How arrogant!\\nThe fact is that American pharmaceutical companies want a monop-\\noly. They do not want anybody competing with their sales; therefore\\nthey have managed to coax the federal government into forbidding any\\nAmerican to purchase a pharmaceutical drug outside of America. They\\nare in effect stopping free trade and stopping competition, which would\\nresult in lower prices. Why is the FDA doing that? As I mentioned to\\nyou before, the drug industry gives millions of dollars to the commis-\\nsioners when they leave the FDA. It\\'s a payoff!\\nRemember: Drug companies do not want people to get well. A drug\\ncompany\\'s goal is not to cure disease. If everyone in the world was\\nhealthy, the drug companies would be out of business. A drug company\\nonly wants to sell you more drugs. So here is how the cycle works.\\nThe drug industry gives billions of dollars to medical schools.\\nWhy? So that their drugs can be put in the textbooks and doctors are\\ntaught to prescribe certain pharmaceutical drugs, thus guaranteeing\\nsales of those drugs by the pharmaceutical company. Remember, in\\nmedical school doctors are taught two things: to prescribe drugs and\\nto cut out parts of a person\\'s anatomy, which is surgery.\\nWhen a doctor comes out of medical school, most people don\\'t know\\nthat the pharmaceutical industry then pays that doctor to prescribe\\ncertain drugs.

In order for a drug company to get a drug patented and\\napproved by the FDA, it costs approximately,  $800 million in research\\nand testing. Where does that $800 million go? Well, let\\'s just follow\\nthe money trail. Remember, it\\'s always just about the money!\\nThe companies that are approved by the FDA to do certain\\nresearch, interestingly enough, are publicly traded companies. Guess\\nwho owns the stock in these publicly traded companies? Would it\\nsurprise you to know that politicians and members of the FDA own\\nstock in those companies? It wouldn\\'t surprise me! Would it also\\nsurprise you that the people that work for those research companies\\nare friends and relatives of politicians and members of the FDA? It\\nwouldn\\'t surprise me!\\nOnce a drug is approved and the pharmaceutical company has the\\npatent, it becomes the only company that can sell that drug. Getting a\\npatented drug is an automatic billion dollars in the bank! This is why\\nyou will never see a pharmaceutical company promoting a natural\\ncure. Natural cures cannot be patented! You can only make profits if\\nyou have a patented drug. There are no large profits in selling a natu-\\nral cure that cannot be patented. When you have a patented product\\nyou are the only company that can sell it. You have no competition.\\nYou can sell it for an outrageously high price, and the profits are\\nguaranteed. If you are selling a nonpatented natural product, a hun-\\ndred other companies could also sell the same product. You have no\\nmonopoly. Because of the competition, the prices will come down and\\nthe profits become incredibly small. That is why the drug industry will\\nonly promote patented drugs, because that\\'s where the profits are.\\nThis is also why the drug companies gave tens of millions of dollars\\nto lobbyists to get the FDA to make a new \"law.\" Listen to this very\\ncarefully. The FDA has the power to make \"laws\" and enforce them.\\nIt can make \"laws\" without congressional approval or debate.

The\\nbottom line is the government and politicians can say anything on TV,\\nand it is never challenged and it is presented as 100 percent truth.\\nBig business can do almost anything on TV and produce false and\\nmisleading advertising without the FTC preventing them.\\nSmall businesses or companies threatening the profits of \"big\\nbusiness\" are the ones routinely attacked by the FTC, the FDA and\\nother regulatory agencies. It is surprising to note that the majority of\\nactions taken by the FTC and FDA are against small- and medium-sized\\nbusinesses. They rarely if ever go after big business. For example, the\\nFTC\\'s Field Manual states that agents should not go after \"big business\"\\nbecause they have deep pockets and will fight back against the FTC. It\\ninstructs its agents not to go after very small businesses because they\\nhave no money. It states to go after medium-sized businesses that will\\nsettle quickly out of fear. It\\'s shocking to note that the Federal Trade\\nCommission does not take action against companies based on consum-\\ner complaints. Rather, the FTC succumbs to political pressure on who\\nto go after and makes its decision based on the amount of money that\\ncan be extracted from that company.\\nDid you know that when the FTC charges a company with false\\nand misleading advertising and then collects money for \"consumer\\nredress,\" it never gives the money to the consumer? The FTC keeps\\nthe money! This agency is supposed to protect the consumers, yet the\\nvast majority of actions filed by the FTC are against companies where\\nthere are no consumer complaints.\\nThe FTC and the FDA also work together to spread misinformation\\nand lies about all-natural remedies.

So-called consumer\\nadvocate associations, or watchdog groups, have sprung up with fancy\\nnames that sound like they are looking out to protect the consumer\\nwhen in fact these particular organizations are nothing more than\\na front for the pharmaceutical industry to promote their products,\\nincrease drug usage, and increase the nation\\'s perception that natural\\nremedies don\\'t work and are dangerous.\\nA good example of this is ephedra. Ephedra is a compound most\\ncommonly found in the herb ma huang.

In a very well orchestrated debunking campaign, the FDA has\\nbanned the use of ephedra stating it is dangerous. This was a very coor-\\ndinated effort to get people to believe that a natural herbal supplement\\ncould be dangerous. This campaign is designed to encourage Congress\\nto ban more natural remedies, as well as require supplements as harm-\\nless as basic vitamins and minerals to be classified as drugs and be\\nsold by prescription and manufactured by the pharmaceutical indus-\\ntry. This is being touted under the guise of safety. Safety has nothing\\nto do with it. Why?\\nEphedra was banned because 153 deaths have been linked to tak-\\ning ephedra. Now, millions of people were taking ephedra. If you take\\nany group of ten million people, over a year, there\\'s a good chance\\nthat 153 people in that group will die. The FDA said there is a \"link\"\\nbetween ephedra use and those deaths. There is absolutely no con-\\nclusive evidence that ephedra caused those deaths or even had any\\nremote association with those deaths. However, the FDA keeps say-\\ning how dangerous ephedra is. Every single nonprescription drug is\\ndangerous! If you went into your medicine cabinet, took a drug, and\\ntook more than what the label said, there is a high probability that\\nyou could die. Every single drug is incredibly dangerous. This is not\\nabout danger, it is about who controls these products. The scary part\\nis whatever the FDA says, it is presented as truth and no opposing\\nopinions are allowed to be heard.\\nThink about this. Two thousand people die every year by simply\\ntaking aspirin. Not overdosing on aspirin but by taking aspirin in the\\nrecommended amounts. Wow! It appears that aspirin is not safe.

The fact is that you can create a study to show\\nvirtually anything you want, but the news media chose only to talk\\nnegatively about the herbal, all-natural supplement and didn\\'t have\\nanything negative to say about the drug. Debunking by use of studies\\nis very common. Most \"studies\" are funded by the drug industry. The\\nresearchers are given very specific parameters and objectives. Since\\nthese studies are funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the objectives\\nare to show that drugs are effective and safe, and all-natural treatments\\nare ineffective and dangerous.

The American Medical Association is a\\nunion designed to protect its members, which are the medical doctors\\nand the medical industry. But it is always being presented as an indepen-\\ndent, unbiased body presenting medical facts to the world, with a goal of\\ncuring disease, which simply is not the case. Just read their charter.\\nThe history of the AMA is fascinating. The AMA was founded in\\n1847 in Philadelphia. While there were many state medical asso-\\nciations at the time, the need to establish a national association that\\nwould look after the interests of medical doctors nationwide was\\ndetermined to be paramount one year earlier at the New York medical\\nconvention. At the time, doctors were not the majority of heathcare\\npractitioners in America dealing with the cure and prevention of ill-\\nness and disease. There were vast amounts of homeopathic and other\\npractitioners using natural remedies. The very next year after being\\ncreated, the AMA began its organized assault on debunking natural\\nremedies and discrediting any health-care practitioner who was not\\na medical doctor. At the same time it set out to establish the laws\\ngoverning patent medicine. This practice has continued ever since,\\nthus establishing the health-care monopoly for the medical doctor as\\nthese continued to expand into the areas of drug manufacturing and\\nmedical research. Today, the American Medical Association stands as\\nthe largest and most powerful health-care association in the world.\\nIt has amassed enough power and influence to create laws that help\\nexpand the business of its members while at the same time eliminat-\\ning any competition that might threaten their outrageous profits.\\nFrom this position of power, the AMA filed a lawsuit against the\\nchiropractors in Illinois. Chiropractors at the time were saying that\\nchiropractic adjustments can alleviate pain. Many people were going to\\nchiropractors instead of medical doctors. The AMA, in order to protect\\nits members, filed a lawsuit against the chiropractors. The chiropractors\\nfought back and fought back big time. The chiropractors won. It was\\nproven in court that chiropractic treatments were better at eliminating\\nor reducing pain than anything that medical doctors could offer.

Their response\\nwas \"we\\'ll look into it.\" But they assured me that if I ran these ads\\naction would be taken against me immediately. We are supposed to\\nhave equal protection under the law. Selective prosecution is allegedly\\nforbidden in this country. Unfortunately, that\\'s not how it works. The\\nbottom line here is that the government is working together with the\\npharmaceutical industry to take control of all-natural remedies. For\\nexample, in Germany and Norway the drug companies have virtually\\ntaken over the entire health food industry. Vitamin B1 , vitamin C and\\nvitamin E, in certain amounts, are illegal in these countries. A major\\npharmaceutical company now controls the herb echinacea, and sells\\nit as an over-the-counter drug at exorbitant prices. Selling herbs as\\nfood, in certain parts of Europe, is now a criminal offense.\\nAm I the only voice expressing outrage? No. There are thousands\\nof medical doctors, scientists, surgeons, and ex-pharmaceutical\\ninsiders who know the truth and are desperately trying to educate\\nthe public. Hundreds of books have been written on these subjects. I\\nam not the only author or consumer advocate addressing these criti-\\ncal and timely subjects.

ACT NOW!\\nLargely unbeknownst to the American people there is a war going\\non that has claimed victims in every family. This war is escalating and\\nthreatens every human life. It is a war being waged in the interests of\\nthe multibillion dollar pharmaceutical industry, which is not a health\\nindustry but rather an investment business built on the continuation\\nand expansion of global diseases. Your health and the health of every\\nperson in America are threatened in several ways:\\n1.\"The business with disease\" as the basis of the pharmaceuti-\\ncal industry. The pharmaceutical industry is a multibillion dol-\\nlar investment business that has orchestrated the largest fraud\\nin human history. It promises health, but in fact thrives on the\\ncontinuation of diseases. This fraud scheme is easily unmasked.\\nMost pharmaceutical drugs are designed to merely cover disease\\nsymptoms, but are not intended to cure or eradicate diseases. As\\na direct result of this multibillion dollar fraud business, no cure\\nhas ever been found for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes,\\nor any other chronic disease. On the contrary, these diseases\\ncontinue in epidemic proportions, killing about 5,000 Americans\\nevery day. This compares to the annihilation of a city the size of\\nSan Francisco every year.\\n2.The epidemic of dangerous side effects caused by pharmaceutical\\ndrugs. The dangerous side effects of Vioxx, Celebrex, Lipitor, and\\nProzac are not the exception, they are the rule. Due to their syn-\\nthetic nature, most pharmaceutical drugs are toxic to our bodies,\\ncausing organ damage and other serious side effects. According\\nto the American Medical Association, one million American suf-\\nfered disabilities from taking pharmaceutical drugs and more than\\n100,000 of them die as a result of this every single year.\\n3.Legislation that protects the expansion of the deadly business\\nwith disease. For decades drug companies have used their giant\\nprofits to manipulate the public and influence legislation, includ-\\ning that from the U.S. Congress and the White House. Now that the\\ndeadly consequences of the pharmaceutical fraud business have\\nbeen unmasked the survival of this industry depends on the pro-\\ntectionist laws.

This medical liability legislation is being\\nused as a cover to grant amnesty to drug manufacturers, protecting\\nthem from having to compensate millions of patients for the harm\\ntheir drugs have caused. It is payback for the pharmaceutical indus-\\ntry, which was the largest corporate sponsor of the Bush election\\ncampaign. The people of America and their political representatives\\nhave to realize that the proposed medical liability legislation is a\\n\"Trojan Horse.\" Passing it means granting immunity to the drug\\nmakers, allowing them the unrestricted expansion of their deadly\\nbusiness with disease at the expense of patients. As the direct conse-\\nquence of this law, tens of millions of Americans will suffer disability\\nand die from preventable diseases within the next decades.\\n4.Withholding life-saving information about the health benefits of\\nvitamins and natural therapies. A precondition for this \"business\\nwith disease\" based on patentable synthetic drugs is the suppres-\\nsion of effective and safe, but nonpatentable and therefore less prof-\\nitable, natural therapies. For decades the pharmaceutical industry\\nhas strategically expanded its influence on medical education\\nwith devastating results. It has deliberately blocked any informa-\\ntion about the essential role of vitamins and other micronutrients\\nin maintaining health contained in every textbook of biology,\\nbiochemistry, and natural science from entering medical school\\nteaching and medical practice. Through their strategic influence,\\nthe pharmaceutical industry has established a global monopoly on\\nmedicine. As a direct result, generations of medical doctors have\\nnot received adequate training in nutritional and other natural\\ntherapies. Doctors and patients alike have become victims of the\\npharmaceutical industry\\'s efforts to monopolize human health. As\\na result, tens of millions of Americans have died unnecessarily over\\nthe past decades because this life-saving health information has\\nnot been available to them.\\n5.Suppressing effective natural therapies by law.

The FTC\\'s other main goal is to\\nmake sure that consumers are not \"ripped off\" by companies. Yet in\\nactual fact, the FTC has no interest in protecting consumers.\\nLet me give you an example from my own personal experience.\\nThis is not an isolated case. I can show you hundreds of examples\\nproving that this is in fact the standard operating procedure of the\\nFTC. Here is what it looks like:\\nI was excited about a product called coral calcium. This product\\nis simply calcium, the source being coral sand from Okinawa, Japan.\\nCalcium is harmless, has many proven health benefits, is an essential\\nnutrient for the body, and has been sold for years without any issues.\\nI produced a TV infomercial interviewing an author who was giv-\\ning his opinions about the potential health benefits of supplementing', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

I then sent this infomercial to the FTC. I tele-\\nphoned the FTC on several occasions. I wrote the FTC several letters.\\nI sent several e-mails. I kept asking the FTC if they had any issues\\nwith my television commercial promoting the product coral calcium.\\nI informed the FTC that if there were any concerns or questions they\\nneeded answered, to please communicate that to me as my intention\\nand desire was to be 100 percent cooperative in every way.\\nThe FTC responded on several occasions that they had no issues\\nwith my promotion of coral calcium. The coral calcium product was\\nbeing embraced by the public. Thousands of letters kept pouring in\\ntelling of the incredible health benefits people were experiencing\\nfrom taking coral calcium. The return rate of the product was one\\nof the lowest in the entire dietary supplement industry. There were\\nvirtually no complaints, and everyone seemed to like coral calcium.\\nUnbeknownst to me, the FTC was conducting a secret investigation\\ninto the sale and promotion of coral calcium and were coordinating\\ntheir efforts with the FDA. During the entire investigation, the FTC\\nnever called us or requested any information from us at all.\\nSuddenly, without warning, the FTC filed a major lawsuit against\\nme, my company, and the author I interviewed. The lawsuit stated\\nthat we were making unsubstantiated health claims about the benefits\\nof coral calcium. They went to court and asked for an emergency rul-\\ning demanding that the company be shut down and all of my personal\\nassets frozen.\\nThis is the modus operandi of the FTC.\\nFirst, they conduct a secret investigation. No matter how coopera-\\ntive you want to be, they refuse to talk to or question the company or\\nindividual that they are getting ready to pounce on. Second, they go\\ninto court and demand that the companies be shut down and all assets\\nfrozen. Unbelievable as it sounds, the FTC wins this request over 97\\npercent of the time. The opposing side is given virtually no time to\\nrespond and is, in effect, put out of business. It may also surprise you\\nto know that when the FTC files suit, it is not required to go to federal\\ncourt. Instead, the FTC suits are presented before an \"administrative\\nlaw judge\" who is actually an employee of the FTC! The \"courtroom\"\\nis in the FTC building itself! No wonder the FTC wins 97 percent of\\nthe time.

The three\\nmost outrageous things to look at are:\\n1.The FTC stated that we were making unsubstantiated and false health\\nclaims about coral calcium. However, how could the FTC make that\\nallegation when they never asked us to produce any substantiation\\nthat we may have had? Making the allegation without asking us or\\nreviewing the substantiation that we had is in itself a false and mis-\\nleading statement. The FTC is guilty of making false and misleading\\nstatements and then presenting them to the media as facts.\\n2.Where are all the complaining customers? If our advertising was so\\ndeceptive, customers would have complained and returned the prod-\\nuct. The FTC\\'s response to this is that the public is too stupid to know\\nthat the ad violated the FTC rules.\\n3.Why didn\\'t the FTC contact us or respond to our multitude of\\nletters, phone calls, and e-mails? For over a year and a half, the\\nFTC knew about our ad. We repeatedly asked them if they had\\nany issues. They repeatedly said no. Then the sudden lawsuit and\\nthe subsequent demand that the show be pulled off the air. Why\\nthe delay? This is standard operating procedure. If the FTC really\\nthought that our infomercial was not fair to consumers, they could\\nhave asked us to take it off the air eighteen months earlier. Why\\ndid they wait? Because it\\'s all about the money! The FTC routinely\\nwaits for companies to generate large amounts of sales and profits\\nbefore they step in and take action. They do this because they\\ndo not care about the consumer, all they want is money. If they\\nstopped you right in the beginning you wouldn\\'t have any money\\nto give them.\\nThe FTC, in my opinion, is an out-of-control organization. It is not\\nprotecting consumers. It is in fact protecting the profits and monopo-\\nlies established by major corporations. Consider this fact: How many\\nlawsuits has the FTC filed against major corporations for false and\\nmisleading advertising? Answer: None. That\\'s right, none, zero, not\\na single one. However, it routinely files hundreds of lawsuits against\\nsmall companies for false and misleading advertising. Let\\'s look at\\nsome of the ads on television. There is an ad for the drug Levitra. The\\nwoman looks into the camera and says, \"My man uses Levitra...\" This is\\nfalse and misleading. Her man does not use Levitra; this is a paid actress\\nreading a script.

If a small independent company did the exact\\nsame thing they would be prosecuted for CRIMINAL fraud. The most\\nobvious example of the FTC protecting the monopolies\\' profits is in the\\ncase of Celebrex. Celebrex advertising was deemed false and misleading\\nby the FDA itself! That\\'s right, the Food and Drug Administration was\\nunder so much public pressure that it had to do something in response\\nto the flagrant, false, and misleading advertising done by the pharma-\\nceutical company in relation to the Celebrex ad. The FDA said specifi-\\ncally that the ad was \"false and misleading.\"\\nNow here is where the story gets interesting. The FTC is the govern-\\nment agency that has the job of prosecuting companies that produce\\n\"false and misleading advertising.\" To date, the FTC has taken abso-\\nlutely no action against the manufacturers of Celebrex and the produc-\\ners of this \"false and misleading ad.\" This is an outrage. The FTC has\\nthe responsibility to protect consumers from companies that produce\\nfalse and misleading advertising. Here is an ad that the FDA itself has\\nalready deemed false and misleading, but the FTC takes no action.\\nWhy? Because it is protecting the profits of the drug companies. If\\nthis was any other company the FTC would sue the company, demand\\n100 percent consumer redress, and demand a complete freezing of all\\nthe assets of the company and a government receiver put in charge of\\nthat company.

Because the FTC\\nis not protecting consumers from false and misleading advertising, it is\\nin fact protecting the monopolies\\' profits. This is an outrage. Can you\\nsee why I\\'m mad as hell and not going to take it anymore?\\nAnother standard operating procedure that the FTC uses is when\\nit settles a case it puts out press releases. Here is one of the most\\namazing discoveries. When you read the press releases put out by the\\nFederal Trade Commission, you find that the FTC itself is the most fla-\\ngrant violator of its own standards for false and misleading advertising.\\nThe press releases put out by the FTC are all, virtually all, false and\\nmisleading.

It tries to make you believe it is an unbiased source of\\ninformation when this is categorically not true. How can they be unbi-\\nased when they accept advertising from drug companies? How can they\\nbe unbiased when they are publicly traded? How can they be unbiased\\nwhen their only motivation is to make money?\\nSo again, the question is what makes me different? The answer is\\nvery simple. I have decided that for my life it\\'s NOT ALL ABOUT THE\\nMONEY. Making money is not bad. Making a profit is not bad. As I have\\nmentioned before, giving a good quality service at a good value is an\\nadmirable thing to do. Making a profit, making money, and enjoying a\\nbeautiful lifestyle are not bad and evil. The love of money is bad and\\nevil. Making money at the expense of your employees, the environ-\\nment, and a customer is bad and evil.\\nHere is how I\\'ve solved the problem. Here is why you should listen\\nto what I am saying in this book, and in my other books and other\\npublications: I do not take any advertising. I do not sell any product.\\nYou can listen to me because I have no financial incentive in you doing\\nanything relating to your health. If I encourage you to buy a vitamin,\\nor use an alternative natural treatment, I have no financial incentive\\nto give you that advice. As far as I know I am the only health-care\\nadvocate that doesn\\'t sell vitamins and minerals or any food supple-\\nments, I accept no advertising in any of my publications, I get no\\nkickbacks from anyone, I own stock in virtually no companies, and I\\nhave no other goal or motivation other than to see you cure yourself\\nof your disease and stay healthy forever. Folks, consider this: I know\\nthis stuff already. I practice this every day in my life. I don\\'t know you.\\nWhy am I risking everything by filing suits against the Federal Trade\\nCommission and dealing with ridicule, attacks, and criticism? It isn\\'t\\nabout the money. I\\'m giving most of the profits away on the sale of this\\nbook and my other ventures to help promote natural healing around\\nthe world. It\\'s not about the money for me. Yes, I do make good money,\\nand yes I live a very nice lifestyle, but I can tell you I am never going to\\nmake the type of money that the directors and officers of the publicly\\ntraded pharmaceutical companies make.

I\\nreceive all of these newsletters. I read them. In many cases\\nI concur with what is being written, however, there is one\\nmajor, major, major problem. All of these people sell vita-\\nmins, minerals, herbs, or other food supplements. What\\nthis means is that their newsletters are not in fact unbiased\\ninformational publications, but rather cleverly crafted sales\\nletters designed to encourage you to buy their specific vita-\\nmins, minerals, herbs, or food supplements. This means\\nthat when you are reading their publications you can never\\nbe confident in knowing that they are giving unbiased\\ntruthful information, or if they are simply trying to sell you\\ntheir own vitamins, minerals, herbs, and food supplements\\nto make millions of dollars in profits. You just don\\'t know.\\nIt is impossible to trust them because there is such a huge\\nconflict of interest. Their motivation to make money could\\nbe the main overriding factor. That is why, in my opinion,\\nyou can trust what you read in this newsletter, and what\\nyou read on my NaturalCures.com Web site, and what you\\nread in my other books and informational publications. I\\ndo not sell any vitamins, minerals, herbs, or food supple-\\nments. I sell no products at all. I have no financial interest\\nin companies that sell products. I am not compensated in\\nany way on any products that I recommend, endorse, or\\nsuggest. There are no conflicts of interest here.\\nThere are conflicts of interest with every other alternative\\nhealth newsletter. Not surprisingly, there are also conflicts of\\ninterests with every major newspaper, magazine, news radio\\nstation, and news TV station. That\\'s right. There are financial\\nconflicts with all the major media venues where information\\nis disseminated. What does this mean? This means when\\nyou are watching the news on TV and think you are getting\\nunbiased journalism, you are not. You are getting bought and\\npaid for commercials, which are being disguised as news and\\nunbiased journalism. Let me give you a perfect example.

First it was bacteria and\\ngerms. The super wonder drug of the day was antibiotics, which were\\ntouted as the method that would eliminate disease forever and cure\\nall illness, sickness and diseases. The theory was that all disease was\\ncaused by germs, primarily bacteria. This theory has proved to be\\nwrong. Stronger and stronger antibiotics are continually developed,\\nyet people continue to get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. More people\\nare getting more diseases than ever before.\\nThe next theory was that viruses were the cause of all illness and\\ndisease. Unfortunately, few people know that antibiotics have no effect\\non viruses. The doctors continually prescribe antibiotics at the drop\\nof a hat. People have been brainwashed into thinking that antibiotics\\nare needed when they feel sick, and go to their doctors and demand\\nantibiotics. The doctor, who unfortunately is in a business and under-\\nstands his patient is really a customer, has to make the customer happy\\nand prescribes the antibiotic. If the doctor does not, the patient (aka,\\nthe customer) will simply find another doctor who will prescribe an\\nantibiotic. The Associated Press reported that overuse of broad-spec-\\ntrum antibiotics for minor infection poses a serious health threat. The\\ngovernment estimates that half of the one hundred million antibiotic\\nprescriptions written each year are totally unnecessary. Still, people\\ncontinue to get more diseases, more sickness and more illness.\\nThe current theory of the day is all sickness, diseases, and illnesses\\nare caused by genetic defects. Of course the only answer is drugs. Drugs\\nare now being researched and looked at to handle these genetic defects.\\nThe new method of making billions of dollars in profit is to come up\\nwith a genetic defect for every problem a person has. We hear it every\\nday, \"Oh, you\\'re fat because you have a genetic defect, and a drug is\\nbeing worked on that can solve that genetic defect and make you thin.\"\\n\"Diabetes is nothing more than genetics, so we\\'ll work on a drug that will\\ncorrect that genetic disposition and solve the problem.\" Keep in mind\\nthat drug companies really do not want to cure disease as they claim. If\\nthey came up with a cure, they would be out of business.\\nThink of herpes. Herpes is a virus. We hear ads on TV every day\\nthat say \"there is no cure for herpes\"; therefore, in order to suppress\\nthe symptoms, take our beautiful, wonderful drug every day for the\\nrest of your life.

They don\\'t lose their teeth, they don\\'t have\\narthritis, they don\\'t have diabetes, they don\\'t need insulin shots,\\nthey don\\'t have cancer, they don\\'t have asthma, they don\\'t have\\nallergies, they are not constipated, they don\\'t have insomnia, and\\nthey live to be an equivalent of about 180 years old. Interestingly\\nenough, they go through their entire lives without taking any pre-\\nscription or nonprescription drugs.\\nSo is there a way that we as human beings can do some very\\nsimple and easy things that can keep us disease free, illness free and\\nfull of life, energy, and vitality? The answer is: absolutely yes! Let\\'s go\\nback to the cause of all disease and the reason why we are sick.\\nThink about the fact that there are cultures around the world\\nwhere the people have never had cancer or heart disease, or acid\\nreflux disease, or prostate problems, etc. Yet when these people start\\nliving a western lifestyle, amazing things begin to happen to their\\nhealth. They get fat, they start getting sick, and they begin to develop\\nall of the common diseases we hear about today. The question is:\\nWhy do human beings living a western lifestyle have more sickness\\nand disease than other human beings around the globe? The answer\\nis, no one knows!

Einstein\\'s theory of relativity\\nis presented as a fact, but people forget it\\'s called the theory of rela-\\ntivity and not the fact of relativity.\\nThe term \"scientific evidence\" is one of the greatest deceptions of\\nall time.

You are\\nled to believe that \"scientific evidence\" proves that something is true.\\nThis is a false assumption. Every day we hear \"new research shows old\\nresearch to be false.\" The bottom line is, you will hear the term \"scien-\\ntifically proven\" used when the medical community claims they know\\nthe cause of disease.

This is\\nwhere medical science stops. They claim that drugs must be developed\\nto kill these bacteria and viruses. However, they are asking the wrong\\nquestion. The fact is that we are all exposed to bacteria and viruses\\non a daily basis. If one person in your home or office has the flu, then\\nevery single person has been exposed to and \"caught\" the flu virus.\\nWhen anthrax was found in the envelope, not every single person in\\nthat building got anthrax! The question is not whether you will pick up\\nbacteria or a virus, the real question is why do some people succumb to\\nthe bacteria and virus and get sick, and other people do not?\\nTake two people. Expose them both to the flu virus at the same\\ntime. One person comes down with all of the symptoms of the flu and\\nbecomes very sick. The other person shows no symptoms whatsoever,\\nstays healthy, and does not \"get the flu.\" They both got the flu virus!\\nOne person succumbed to it and got sick; the other person did not\\nand remained healthy. Throughout your life you will pick up thou-\\nsands of bacteria and viruses. That is natural. The real question to ask\\nis why your body does not do what it was designed to do: fight off and\\nhandle the bacteria or virus. Why did you succumb to the bacteria\\nor virus? The answer: Your body is out of balance and your immune\\nsystem is weak. If your body was in balance, a state called homeosta-\\nsis, and your immune system was strong, you would never show any\\nsymptoms of any of the viruses or bacteria that you pick up during\\nyour lifetime. You would never get sick because of a virus or bacte-\\nria. Then the question becomes, \"What is causing my body to be out\\nof balance, and what is causing my immune system to be weak?\"\\nI will give you the answer in a moment, but first let\\'s go to the\\nsecond reason people get sick. Remember, you get sick because you\\neither \"catch something\" or something develops in the body on its\\nown. You \"catch something\" because your body is out of balance and\\nyour immune system is weak. You develop something in the body\\neither because your body is out of balance, or a \"toxin\" is getting into\\nyour body and causing the problem to develop.

These four things cause\\nthe body to be \"out of balance.\"\\nI will address each of these four issues. Let\\'s start with toxins.\\nWhat is a toxin? A toxin is a poison.

Now, here is\\nthe big one: The most toxic thing you can put in your body, and the\\nnumber one cause of virtually all illness and disease, is prescription\\nand nonprescription drugs!\\nIn my opinion, probably the number one reason people are sick\\nis because of the amount of drugs they take. The statistics show very\\nconclusively that the more prescription and nonprescription drugs\\na person takes, the sicker they are. Why? Because all drugs have\\nnegative side effects. Let me say it again, all drugs have negative side\\neffects! If you are taking a drug to suppress one symptom, that drug is\\ncausing some other major problem to start developing in your body.\\nEven if you stop taking that drug, the wheels have been set in motion,\\nand in a few weeks or a few monthsâboomâyou have some more\\nsymptoms caused by the first drug you took a few months ago.

The drug com-\\npanies know that all nonprescription and prescription drugs make\\nyou sicker. Yes, they may temporarily suppress the symptoms you\\nare experiencing, but in a very short period of time they cause you\\nto become sicker. A good example of this is Vioxx. Vioxx is a pain\\nmedication. It was an outrageously expensive drug that reduces pain\\nno better than an over-the-counter drug. The drug company that sold\\nVioxx made billions in profits.

When the liver is adversely affected you are prone to dia-\\nbetes, acid reflux, constipation, colon cancer, heart disease, asthma,\\narthritis, and dozens of other illnesses and disease.

Many\\nmeat products are also \"aged.\" This means the dead animal flesh is\\nallowed to rot, permitting deadly bacteria to grow. Remember, if it\\'s not\\norganic, if man has made it, don\\'t eat it!\\nThe same holds true with dairy products. Because of the use of\\ndrugs, growth hormones, pasteurization and homogenization, dairy\\nproducts today are a major health concern unless they are organic,\\nnot pasteurized, and not homogenized. There are two main things to\\nconsider when looking at dairy products, one of which is pasteuriza-\\ntion and the other homogenization. Pasteurization simply heats the\\ndairy product to a very high temperature to kill any bacteria. The\\nmajor problem is it also kills the living enzymes that are in the milk,\\nmaking it much harder to digest in the body and thus making the milk\\na totally unnatural product. But more importantly, and more danger-\\nous, is homogenization.\\nDo you remember the milkman? We used to have the milkman\\ncome to the house to deliver milk. Why did we have to have a milk-\\nman? Why couldn\\'t we just buy our milk in the store? The reason is\\nthe milk went bad very quickly. It spoiled within just a few days.\\nThe food industry said \"We\\'re losing money by not selling milk in\\nour stores. We can\\'t sell milk because it goes bad too quickly.\" So the\\nindustry came up with an incredible solution, a process called homog-\\nenization. When the milkman delivered our milk, you may remember\\nthat the cream separated from the milk. You had to shake up the milk\\nbefore you drank it. The process of homogenization actually spins the\\nmilk at a very high rate breaking down the clusters of molecules within\\nthe milk so that you don\\'t have any separation of the cream and the\\nmilk. Therefore the milk will not spoil within a few days, it can actu-\\nally last a few weeks before going bad. Now that the food industry can\\nhave milk shipped to them, they can put it on the store shelf and they\\ncan sell it, there is no more need for the milkman. The problem is\\nhomogenized and pasteurized milk, and all dairy products, are unnatu-\\nral. The clusters of molecules are so small that when you ingest them\\nthey virtually scar your arteries. They clog up your digestive system,\\nmaking it very difficult to digest food, which is one of the major causes\\nof acid reflux disease, obesity, allergies, and constipation. And the scar-\\nring of the arteries causes the LDL cholesterol to attach itself to the\\nartery, which is one of the major causes or arteriosclerosis, which is\\none of the major causes of heart disease.

However, because\\nof the massive dumping of poisonous chemicals into out lakes, rivers,\\nand oceans, many wild fish have been found to have abnormally high\\nlevels of toxic chemicals in them as well.

And the way they do that is to sell more\\nfood, and produce that food at a lower cost. Always remember that,\\nit's always about the money.\\nThe food industry puts tens of thousands of chemical ingredients\\ninto the food and, in many cases, they do not have to list those ingre-\\ndients on the label. How do they get away with that? Through our lob-\\nbyist friends, and by paying off politicians and members of the Food\\nand Drug Administration. It's all about the money.\\nSo why is that bad?\\nThe additives being put in the food are unnatural, toxic chemicals.\\nThey adversely affect the body; they suppress your immune system\\nmaking it more susceptible to disease; they make you age quicker, and\\nthey turn your body from the natural alkaline pH state to the acid pH\\nstate, which means you can easily be prone to cancer, heart disease,\\ndiabetes, allergies, etc., etc., etc.\\nNot only are these chemical additives toxic, when they are put into\\nthe food the processing of the food strips away much of the nutritional\\nvalue. As I mentioned before, if you were to eat a regular apple, it\\nwould have only one-fifth of the nutrition of an apple fifty years ago.\\nBut once the food is processed and put in a box or a can, you're going\\nto have to eat 100 times more to get the same nutritional value; nutri-\\ntion is virtually wiped out. So in addition to having the poisons put in\\nyour system from the chemicals not even listed on the label, the food\\nyou are getting has almost no nutritional value. Plus, these food addi-\\ntives actually block absorption of nutrients. Not only are you not getting\\nenough nutrients from the food you are eating, but what little nutrients\\nyou are getting are being blocked and not absorbed. This means every-\\none has nutritional deficiencies causing imbalance, and a weakened\\nimmune system, which makes you both susceptible to viruses and bac-\\nteria, and causes your body to develop diseases and pain.\\nWhy are these food additives put in the food anyway? Well it's very\\ninteresting.

You\\ndevelop diseases because toxins, nutritional deficiencies, or energetic\\nimbalances allow disease to develop in the genetically weak areas of\\nyour system.

It is important\\nto understand why we have disease and illness, why we are sick, and\\nwhat the causes are for us to totally understand how to cure these\\ndiseases.

This is fine, as long\\nas our body's ability to eliminate these toxins is operating normally.\\nEven if you put no toxins into your body, your body would still cre-\\nate waste material and toxins. All toxins created by the body or put\\ninto the body must be eliminated in order for us to be healthy. When\\ntoxins are allowed to accumulate they cause the immune system to\\nbe suppressed, and the body to become acidic. Accumulated toxins\\nthat have not been flushed out or eliminated allow the body to create\\nan environment where illness and disease can flourish. We basically\\neliminate toxins through:\\nâ¢The nose\\nâ¢The mouth\\nâ¢The urinary tract\\nâ¢The colon\\nâ¢The skin\\nThe nose and mouth eliminate toxins primarily by use of the lungs.\\nOur urinary tract eliminates toxins primarily through the kidneys\\nand liver. The colon eliminates toxins primarily through the liver,\\nthe stomach and small intestine. The skin eliminates toxins primarily\\nthrough perspiration. Most people today have excess accumulations of\\ntoxins and waste material in their bodies. The two main reasons for\\nthis are: 1) they are putting huge amounts of toxins in their body on\\na regular basis; 2) their elimination channels are clogged, slow, and\\nsluggish.\\nWhen you put toxins in and your body creates toxins at a faster\\nrate than you are eliminating those toxins, you have a build-up and\\naccumulation of poisons and toxins in the body. For example, are\\nyour nasal and sinus cavities clear and mucus free? Do you breathe\\nfully and deeply from your diaphragm, allowing your lungs to do their\\njob fully? Do you regularly breathe aerobically and anaerobically? Do\\nyou sweat on a regular basis? Do you drink plenty of water, which\\nallows all elimination channels to work more efficiently?

If you have ever taken an antibiotic you have dramati-\\ncally slowed your elimination potential via the colon. Antibiotics\\nkill all the friendly bacteria in the intestine and colon. This allows\\nunfriendly yeast, most notably candida, to grow abnormally and\\ninfest your digestive system. This candida yeast overgrowth slows\\ndigestion, increases gas, bloating and constipation, and itself creates\\nan abnormal amount of toxins.\\nâ¢Lotions and creams. Most people put lotions and creams all over\\ntheir skin clogging the pores and suppressing the natural elimina-\\ntion process through the skin. This would include sunscreens, cos-\\nmetics, deodorants, and antiperspirants.\\nâ¢Lack of body movement. Have you ever noticed when you take a\\ndog for a walk, they poop? When you move your body as nature\\nintended, you increase the elimination process. Since most people\\nsit all day, their elimination cycles are suppressed. You should\\nhave three bowel movements per day. When you eat food, it goes\\nthrough the digestion process and ends up in the colon ready for\\nelimination. The food in the colon begins to putrefy and become\\ntoxic. The longer it stays in the colon, the more toxic it becomes. If\\nleft long enough, these toxins begin to enter the bloodstream. This\\ncan turn into a serious medical condition resulting in death. Your\\nbody\\'s elimination system must be working at optimal levels if you\\nwant to live without illness and disease.\\nExercise\\nIn simplistic terms, there are seven kinds of exercise:\\n1. Slow rhythmic movement exercise. This is mainly walking. The\\nbody is designed to walk, for long distances, and for long periods\\nof time. The amount of walking in America varies per geographic\\narea. New Yorkers tend to walk more than people living in Dallas.\\nWhen you go to Europe or various other countries, people walk\\nan average of eight to ten miles a day. In America people walk an\\naverage of close to one-tenth of a mile a day. That is unbelievable.\\nWalking is probably the most important form of exercise you can\\ndo, and the healthiest compared to driving, which increases stress.\\nNow let\\'s think about this for a moment. When you drive a car your\\nstress levels go up dramatically, which means your body becomes\\nacidic.

You are also\\nactually looking out and externalizing through your eyes at far away\\ndistances, which increases the electromagnetic energy in your body\\nand makes the body more alkaline and less susceptible to disease.\\nIt also has a profound effect on your state of mind and happiness\\nfactor. The lack of walking causes the body's elimination channels\\nto become slow and sluggish.\\n2.Stretching. Your body consists of muscles, tendons, and ligaments.\\nIf you lived in a natural setting, interacting with nature as we are\\ndesigned, the natural activities you would be doing throughout your\\nday would cause the frequent stretching of your ligaments, muscles\\nand tendons. Americans are the least flexible people in the world.\\nLack of flexibility allows for negative energy and toxins to accumu-\\nlate in various parts of your body, allowing toxicity to build up.\\n3.Resistance exercise. This includes any form of movement where\\nresistance is put against a muscle, and the muscle is required\\nto push or pull against the resistance. The most common form\\nof resistance training is weight lifting or the use of resistance\\nmachines. This is an unnatural form of exercise. Chimpanzees, as\\nan example, are eight times stronger than a man, yet do not lift\\nweights. Weight training can increase the size and strength of mus-\\ncles, reshaping your body and making you look great. However,\\nit generally only works with the muscles that are seen and does\\nnot address the majority of muscles that have no aesthetic value.\\nIt also does not address the strength of ligaments and tendons.\\nThis can create an imbalance, where some muscles are strong\\nand abnormally large, and other muscles, ligaments and tendons\\nare weak and disproportionate in size. Weight training does not\\nincrease flexibilityâit actually reduces flexibility, thus hindering\\nthe flow of energy through the body. Nevertheless, doing any form\\nof exercise is better than doing none at all.\\n4.Postures. There are certain exercise regimes where you are put into\\npostures that are held for a period of time. The most commonly\\nknown is yoga. Keep in mind there are many forms of yoga. Not all\\nkinds of yoga are posture based. Some yoga techniques are fluid and\\nmovement oriented.

Aerobic means \"with air.\" Any form of exercise\\nwhere you are breathing heavily but can still have a conversa-\\ntion is aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise stimulates blood flow\\nthroughout the body, oxygenates the body and speeds the elimina-\\ntion of toxins.\\n6.Anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic means \"without air.\" Any form of\\nexercise where you are breathing so hard you can barely talk is\\nanaerobic. The benefits are, generally, a tremendous stimulation\\nof your entire system because, in effect, you are putting the surviv-\\nal of every cell in your body at risk because of the lack of oxygen.\\nThis is very helpful in \"reprogramming the body\" and allowing the\\nbody to increase its elimination of toxins and stop any cellular\\nactivity that was abnormal.\\n7.Cellular exercise. At this time there is only one form of exercise\\nthat actually affects, in a positive way, every cell in the body\\nsimultaneously. Jumping on a mini-trampoline, also known as a\\nrebounder, has been shown to stimulate and strengthen every cell\\nin the body. This unique form of exercise dramatically increases\\nthe movement through the lymph system, stimulates every cell\\'s\\nelimination of toxins, and increases the strength and vitality of\\nevery cell in the body.\\nThe Major Benefits of Exercise Include:\\nâ¢Increase oxygen to the cells. Oxygen is needed for life. Most people\\nare deficient in the amount of oxygen they have throughout their\\nbodies. Viruses and cancer, for example, cannot exist in an oxygen\\nrich environment. An oxygen rich body is an alkaline body. An\\nalkaline body is a body where disease and illness cannot exist.\\nâ¢Movement of lymph fluid. The lymphatic system is an important\\nelement in the elimination process. Most Americans have a lym-\\nphatic system that is dangerously clogged and sluggish. Moving the\\nbody as it was intended increases the movement of lymph fluid\\nthrough the body, assisting with the elimination of toxins.\\nâ¢Cell stimulation.

Every cell in the body needs stimulation to remain\\nhealthy and thrive in a normal way.

Cells could degenerate and die\\nor begin to grow abnormally in an out of control manner, causing\\ntumors, cancer, or the degeneration of vital organs in the body.\\nâ¢Opening of energy channels. Energy flows through our body. Just\\nlike blood flows through the veins, electromagnetic energy flows\\nthrough channels in our body. When these channels are blocked\\nor congested, energy does not flow efficiently. This energy gives\\nlife and vitality to the cells; without it the cells do not receive what\\nis needed, causing abnormalities, suppression of the immune sys-\\ntem, and turning the body acidic, making it susceptible to illness.\\nExercise helps to keep these channels open.\\nâ¢Releasing of tension and stress. Stress is the silent killer. Stress\\ncan be defined many ways. In simplistic terms, stress is holding on\\nto negative energy. When negative energy is being held, it can lodge\\nitself into various parts of the body. This can cause muscles to be\\ntight and the body to become acidic. Exercise breaks up this stress\\nand tension, and can allow it to leave the body.\\nI have mentioned that toxins in the body are a major cause of\\ndisease. I have mentioned that lack of nutrition is a major cause\\nof disease. I suggested very briefly that electromagnetic chaos also\\nhas a negative effect on the body and can lead to and cause disease.\\nIt is important also to know that \"stress\" is also one of the major\\nforces that can cause illness and disease in the body. When some-\\nthing stresses us, our body turns from a natural state of alkaline pH\\nto acidic. When it\\'s acidic, disease can grow. Stress suppresses our\\nimmune system and makes us weaker and more susceptible to infec-\\ntions, germs, bacteria and viruses. When our immune system is weak,\\nwe cannot naturally defend against these invaders and we get sick.\\nSo the question is, what are the stressors and how can we eliminate\\nthem? I will address this question and give you the simple solutions\\nin a later chapter.\\nRest\\nWithout proper rest, the cells are not given the opportunity to recharge\\nand rejuvenate. Tired cells cannot eliminate toxins efficiently. It is\\nalso during rest that most healing takes place. Most people do not get\\nenough rest, and the rest they do get is not full and deep.

The most optimum time for the body\\nto rest is when the sun is no longer shining. Ideally, a person would\\nrest and sleep when the sun goes down and arise when the sun\\ncomes up. This is the natural cycle. However, most people\\'s life-\\nstyles do not allow this. Therefore they are resting and sleeping at\\nnon-optimal times. Each week a lunar cycle occurs starting at sun-\\ndown every Friday ending at sundown every Saturday. This time\\nperiod is absolutely the most ideal time for the body to recharge\\nand rejuvenate.\\n2.The amount of hours you rest. Although every person is different, it\\nappears that every person operates better when getting eight hours\\nof sleep. People operate worse if they receive fewer hours or more\\nhours. The majority of people sleep less than eight hours, and then\\ntry to catch up by occasionally sleeping more hours. This practice\\ndoes not allow optimal recharging and rejuvenation of the cells in\\nyour body.\\n3.Rest and sleep should be deep. Most people toss and turn at night.\\nThe ideal situation is that you virtually do not move for the entire\\nsleep time. When sleep is full and deep, brainwave activity can\\noccur, which stimulates the healing process throughout the body.\\nA person who snores wakes themselves up an average of 300 times\\nper night. A person who snores never gets into the deepest levels of\\nsleep, and thus their body is never operating at optimal efficiency.\\nThere is a difference between sleep and rest. The body can rest\\nwithout going to sleep. Most people never take a \"rest\" during the day.\\nThe common pattern of waking up, working all day nonstop, going to\\nbed late, never getting a full deep eight hours of peaceful sleep, results\\nin a body that slowly begins to break down and never has a chance to\\nheal and recharge. If you were to take a battery powered device and\\nleave it on until the battery died, and compare that to turning the\\ndevice on for a period of time then off for a period of time, and repeat-\\ning this process several times, you would find the battery life can be as\\nhigh as twice as long as nonstop usage. The body is very much like a\\nbattery. The body operates almost identically, utilizing electric current\\nthroughout. It must be given a chance to rest.

Think of\\nit this way. The body has what is known as the immune system. The\\nimmune system fights off any imbalance or disease, virus, germs and\\nbacteria. If your body\\'s immune system is strong and you happen to\\ncatch any bacteria or virus, your body fights it off and you never even\\nnotice that you were exposed or had that particular virus or bacteria\\nor germ. When your immune system is very weak, you are suscep-\\ntible to showing the symptoms of succumbing to that particular virus\\nor bacteria. People that are the healthiest are people with very low\\nstress levels. The common denominator of the healthiest people on\\nthe planet is how they think and what they say. The mind can cause\\nthe immune system to be incredibly strong and actually change the\\ngenetic DNA structure in your body, preventing disease. What you\\nthink and what you say can actually cure disease. Conversely, what\\nyou think and what you say, in other words \"stress,\" can absolutely\\ncause your immune system to be weakened and cause genetic weak-\\nnesses in the body to become active causing you to develop illness\\nand disease. Stress, negative thoughts, negative words coming out\\nof your mouth, all are very powerful in turning your body pH either\\nacidic or alkaline.

Those toxins and chemicals are not com-\\ning out of your body because you are not eliminating things like you\\nshould. We are exercising more but we are not walking, and walking is\\nthe major form of exercise that gives you the most health benefits.

Our immune systems are\\nbeing suppressed and we are becoming more susceptible to illness.\\nSpecifically, the drugs that we are taking are making our immune sys-\\ntems weaker, and are putting so many toxins in our bodies that they are\\nin fact causing many additional illnesses.\\nYou\\'ll notice that every major illness that we face today, those that\\nmost people are popping drugs for, are not in fact caused by bacteria\\nor viruses. We aren\\'t catching them. We develop them in our body.\\nThey are actually self-inflicted illnesses. If your body\\'s immune sys-\\ntem is strong and healthy, when you are exposed to the viruses and\\nbacteria which we all are every single day, your body would simply\\nhandle them and you wouldn\\'t even notice them. If you did have a\\nscratchy throat, if you did have some sniffles or a cough, it would\\nmaybe last a few hours or a day at most. You wouldn\\'t have to take\\nany drug, your body would handle it and deal with it and become\\nstronger because of it. That\\'s the natural way your body reacts. We\\nforget that many of the symptoms we have are actually our body\\'s\\nown defense mechanisms working properly, so we go out and take\\ndrugs and try to suppress them.\\nA good example is a fever. If you have a fever, the body is raising\\nits temperature to fight off some danger. But what we do is, we go out\\nand take something to reduce our fever, allowing the invaders to take\\nover.

It was a rusty nail.\\nI\\'m bleeding, and I\\'m in pain. Help!\" The doctor says that I may have\\nsome infection and gives me some ointment that will kill the bacteria\\nto make sure I don\\'t get an infection. He gives me some type of drug\\nthat will stop the bleeding and sews me up with a surgical procedure\\nto handle the wound. The reason that is acceptable is because the\\ncause of my problem was stepping on a nail. We have addressed the\\ncause. It\\'s not going to repeat itself. We know what the cause is. Now\\nlet\\'s handle the symptoms.\\nIf I was in a car crash and my kidney was ripped open by the metal\\nof the crushed vehicle, rush me to the emergency room and handle\\nmy symptoms. Don\\'t ask: \"Hmm, I wonder what caused this? Let\\'s go\\nfor the cause.\" I can tell you what the cause is. The cause is a piece of\\nmetal ripped my skin open and punctured my kidney; please use drugs\\nand surgery and save my life. Handle the symptoms. The symptoms are,\\n\"I am bleeding profusely, I\\'m about to die.\" Handling the symptoms is\\ngood in that situation.\\nBut if a person has cancer you don\\'t say: \"Hmm, cancer cells...let\\nme cut them out, let me shoot them full of radiation, let me use some\\ndrugs that may kill them.\" Ask yourself why cancer is growing in the\\nbody. The answer is: The body is acidic. What\\'s causing the body to be\\nacidic? Let\\'s find out what is going into the body, what is going out of\\nthe body, what the person thinks, how he is exercising, how he is rest-\\ning and what he is saying, and let\\'s turn this around in a very simple\\nway and then the cancer goes away.

Since every person is different and every condition is differ-\\nent, you need to have a knowledgeable person examine you and give\\nyou appropriate care.

Consider adding\\nsome things slowly into your life. Do these things at a pace and level\\nthat you feel comfortable with. Please note that this is not the complete\\nlist. It is a good starting point. I can tell you that I personally do the\\nmajority of these things the majority of the time. It is important for you\\nto know that perfection is not doing all these things all the time. That\\nwould be fanatical and, quite frankly, impossible for most people.

If you do get\\nsick the severity and duration of the illness will be short. Remember,\\nthe body heals itself! Drugs and surgery do not heal. Doctors do not\\nheal. No treatment heals or cures. The body in effect heals and cures\\nitself. Think about it. If you cut your finger and you don\\'t do anything\\nto it, the body will simply heal. It may take a few days, it may take\\na few weeks, but the body will heal itself. If you cut your finger very\\ndeeply you can HELP THE BODY HEAL BETTER AND FASTER, but\\nyou can\\'t heal the body. Only the body heals itself. This is an impor-\\ntant concept to remember. All of these suggestions in this chapter\\nare designed to help the body heal itself. All of these suggestions are\\ndesigned to ultimately turn your body\\'s pH from acidic, where disease\\nand illness can develop, to the healthy state of alkaline, where disease\\nand illness cannot exist. People always ask me the question, \"How do\\nI turn my body from acidic pH to alkaline pH?\" The answer is, do the\\nthings in this chapter. This is an important concept. There is not one\\nthing that can turn your body from acidic pH to alkaline pH. The rea-\\nson is I don\\'t know what is CAUSING your body to be acidic.

Your body should be treated in a similar\\nfashion. You should be seeing various natural health-care provid-\\ners from a variety of disciplines, even when you don't experience\\nsymptoms. Seeing more than one person is valuable so that all\\nbases are covered. Seeing licensed health-care providers who\\ndo not use drugs and surgery is absolutely 100 percent the most\\nimportant thing you can do to prevent and cure disease. Every\\nperson is different; every condition is different; every situation\\nis different; every individual body is different. The cause of your\\nillness and disease is probably different than someone else who\\nhas the exact same symptoms as you. Therefore, the treatment\\nand cure is going to be different. It is important that you not treat\\nyourself for illness and disease. It is important that you know that\\nyou cannot read a book and treat yourself effectively for illness\\nand disease. It is important that you understand that no one can\\ndiagnose and treat you over the phone or over the Internet. You\\nneed to see someone in person. You need to see someone who does\\nnot use drugs and surgery. You need to see someone who under-\\nstands the cause of illness and disease. How do you find a good\\nhealth-care practitioner? In the back of this book there is a listing\\nof associations and organizations that can provide you with recom-\\nmendations. You can go to my Web site www.naturalcures.com\\nfor a list of licensed health-care practitioners in your area. You can\\ngo to the Yellow Pages and lookup naturopath, oriental medicine,\\nchiropractor, herbalist, colon therapist, massage therapist, etc.\\nYou can go to your local health food store and inquire.

Remember, drugs are poisons. This\\nincludes vaccines. Although opinions vary, many experts believe\\nthat vaccines are the number one cause of deaths and disease in\\nchildren. Vaccines are some of the most toxic things you can put\\nin your body.\\nLast year over 250,000 Americans died by taking the proper dos-\\nage of prescription and nonprescription drugs. It is estimated that\\nmillions had to receive medical treatment because of the horrible\\nside effects from taking prescription and nonprescription drugs. It\\nis also estimated that tens of millions will develop long-term medi-\\ncal conditions because they took nonprescription and prescrip-\\ntion drugs. In my opinion, drugs should only be taken in the most\\nsevere cases. This step is so important. You have to know that if you\\nare taking any nonprescription or prescription drugs you absolutely\\nwill get sick and develop disease! Let me say that again, and let me\\nbe perfectly clear. If you continue to take nonprescription over-the-\\ncounter drugs and/or prescription drugs you absolutely will get sick.\\nThese nonprescription drugs and prescription drugs are poisons and\\ntoxins and CAUSE illness and disease! You must stop taking them\\nif you intend on preventing and curing any disease. You cannot\\ncure your disease if you continue to take nonprescription and pre-\\nscription drugs. You cannot prevent disease if you continue to take\\nnonprescription and prescription drugs. In my opinion, you should\\nclean out your medicine cabinet and stop giving your money to the\\ncriminals who run the drug companies.\\n3.Energetic rebalancing.\\nFrequency generators have been around for decades.

If it\\'s out of the proper range\\nI can look at the various things I am doing or not doing, allowing\\nmyself to make simple adjustments in my life to correct the out\\nof balance pH. The reason this is so important is because it takes\\nyears and years to develop most diseases. When you are checking\\nyour pH on a regular basis, even if it goes out of balance, as long as\\nyou correct it and bring it back to balance you are never allowing\\nyour body a long enough time to develop any disease. In my opin-\\nion it\\'s the simplest easy way to make sure you virtually can never\\nget cancer or any other major disease. The pH testing procedure for\\nyour urine and saliva can be found at www.naturalcures.com.\\nThe above four suggestions are what I call the basic four for the\\nprevention and treatment of all disease. These are the very, very basic\\nthings that, in my opinion, you must do if you are serious about pre-\\nventing and curing disease. However, we know that the causes of all\\ndisease are (1) too many toxins in the body, (2) nutritional deficien-\\ncies, (3) electromagnetic chaos, and (4) stress. Therefore, we must\\naddress each of these areas with specific recommendations on how to\\nachieve (a) no toxins in the body, (b) no nutritional deficiencies, (c)\\nno electromagnetic chaos, and (d) no stress.\\nHere are the specific recommendations.

Doing a parasite cleanse\\nis another \"natural cure\" they don\\'t want you to know about.\\n7.Do a candida cleanse.\\nIf you have ever taken a single dose of antibiotics any time in\\nyour life, you have a candida yeast overgrowth in your body. This\\novergrowth is most common in the intestine, but can infiltrate\\nyour entire body. This overgrowth can be a cause of virtually every\\nsymptom you can imagineâheadaches, gas bloating, indigestion,\\nheartburn, nausea, allergies, asthma, Fibromyalgia, arthritis, dia-\\nbetes, constipation, yeast infections, dandruff, acne, bad breath,\\nfatigue, depression, stress, and on and on. Doing a program that\\neliminates the excess candida from your body is one of the back-\\nbones of good health. The most common side effect of excess can-\\ndida is the inability to lose weight. People who eliminate excess\\ncandida virtually always lose massive amounts of weight without\\ntrying. Candida also causes food cravings and can make you eat\\nwhen you\\'re not hungry. When candida is normalized, a person\\'s\\nappetite can be dramatically reduced so that you\\'re just simply\\nnot that hungry.

They are natural, they are\\nnot patentable, nobody\\'s making billions of dollars on them, and they\\nexpose the fact that the drug industry and the food industry are caus-\\ning the majority of illness and disease by feeding us ch emical poisons.\\nThis is a fact that the powers that be don\\'t want you to know about,\\nbut the fact is indisputable.\\nDr. Schultz, www.dr-schulze.com, has a program of cleanses called\\n\"The Incurables.\" It has been reported that when people simply do\\nsome cleanses, such as those listed above, that incurable diseases are\\nmiraculously cured.

This is what medical\\nscience does not want you to know. They don\\'t want you to know what\\nis causing your disease; they only want to sell you drugs to suppress\\nthe symptoms. Imagine a guy who says, \"Every time I pour gasoline all\\nover my house and light it with a match it burns to the ground. What\\'s\\nthe cure?\" You would laugh at such a ridiculous statement, but that is\\nin fact what people do every day in relation to their own diseases. They\\ncome in and say, \"What\\'s the cure for my disease?\" not realizing that\\nthey are in fact causing the disease by what they put in their body. The\\ntoxins that you are putting in your body are giving you the symptoms\\nand disease. A question that comes up is which one of these is more\\nimportant, or will have a more profound affect. The answer is every per-\\nson is different; however, generally speaking, the more powerful tech-\\nniques are at the top of each list. Sometimes just making one change\\ncan cause your symptoms to vanish. You must keep in mind that it has\\ntaken you years and years to develop your symptoms and disease. They\\ndidn\\'t develop overnight, and if you stop putting the toxins in the symp-\\ntoms are not going to vanish necessarily overnight, although in some\\ncases they do. Generally, it takes weeks or months for the symptoms to\\nslowly diminish and vanish unless, of course, as I mentioned, you are\\nat the point of no return.\\nWith that in mind, here is a powerful list of things to do and things\\nto not do that will reduce the deadly poisons from going into your body\\nand allow you to prevent and cure illness and disease.\\n1. Do not eat any food produced or sold by a publicly traded\\ncorporation or is a \"brand name\" product.\\nWow! This is a tough one. If it comes in any massed produced\\npackaging, that means it came from a mass production processing\\nplant. If you have ever been in a mass production food processing\\nfacility, you would understand what I am talking about.

So, virtually all food that\\nyou buy at the supermarket that comes in a package is loaded with\\ndangerous chemicals. Secondly, the mass production processing\\ndramatically changes the energetic structure of the food, as proven\\nwith the use of Kirlian photography.\\nMass produced food in packages is simply unhealthy. Please do\\nnot believe what the fancy packaging say. The food companies are\\nonly interested in profits and getting you to buy the food. They are\\nallowed to lie, deceive, and mislead so that they can coerce you to\\nbuy their product. If you must buy something in a box, jar, can, or\\npackage, buy something that was produced by hand in a very small\\nfacility. Also look for the words \"100% organic\" and read the ingredi-\\nent list. It still may not be great, but at least it\\'s better than buying\\nmass produced, non-organic products. Do not be deceived by the\\nwords \"all-natural,\" \"fat free,\" \"sugar free,\" \"low in carbs,\" \"light,\"\\n\"healthy,\" etc. The food industry has lobbied Congress to allow\\nthese words to be put on virtually anything. They are meaningless,\\ndeceptive, and in my opinion, fraudulent.\\n2.Get all metal out of your dental work.\\nIt is vitally important that you see a holistic dentist. It is absolutely\\nvital for you to know that so many people suffer horrible debilitat-\\ning symptoms that are directly caused by the metal that is in their\\ndental work. At the back of the book under my newsletter section\\nI wrote an article which addressed this at length. I would highly\\nencourage you to read it. Simply doing this step, for many, many\\npeople, is the cure for their disease.

Virtually all tap water is loaded with\\ncontaminants, toxins, poisons, and known cancer causing agents\\nincluding deadly fluoride and chlorine. Drinking tap water causes\\nillness and disease.\\nYou must drink water. However, the water must be pure. Bottled\\nspring water (some bottled spring waters are purer than others),\\nwater filtered using reverse-osmosis, and water purified through\\nsteam distillation, are all better options than tap water.

Your skin absorbs the water from your\\nshower or bath. A hot shower produces steam and that turns many\\nof the chemicals in the water into poisonous gases. These gases\\nare inhaled or absorbed through the skin. A good shower filter\\nremoves most of the toxins in the water. Use one and you\\'ll never\\nhave a bad hair day again. For my personal recommendations go\\nto www.naturalcures.com.\\n6.Eat only 100% organic food.\\nYou want to eat food that has not been grown with chemical fertil-\\nizers, pesticides, or herbicides.

I believe that when you microwave any-\\nthing it becomes energetically toxic to the body. Eating microwaved\\nfood on a regular basis (this includes food that is being reheated in\\nthe microwave) weakens your immune system and causes depres-\\nsion and anxiety. Parents who microwave baby formula are poison-\\ning their children unknowingly. The baby formula itself is poison; by\\nmicrowaving it, it becomes even more toxic. For more information\\nread my newsletter article in the back of the book.\\n9.Eliminate aspartame and monosodium glutamate.\\nAspartame goes by NutraSweetÂ®. Both aspartame and MSG are\\nclassified as excitotoxins. There are three great books on this sub-\\nject. Aspartame, Is it Safe? was written by a medical doctor. Based\\non hundreds of case studies, the doctor concludes that aspartame\\nis responsible for many distressing medical problems, ranging from\\nheadaches and memory loss to hyperactivity in children and seizure\\ndisorders. Next, the book Excitotoxins, The Taste That Kills, also\\nwritten by a medical doctor, examines how monosodium glutamate,\\naspartame, and similar substances cause harm to the brain and ner-\\nvous system, and how these substances can cause Alzheimer\\'s, Lou\\nGherig\\'s disease, depression, MS, and more. Lastly, In Bad Taste,\\nThe MSG Complex, again written by a medical doctor, explains how\\nMSG is a major cause of treatable and preventable illnesses such as\\nheadaches, asthma, epilepsy, heart irregularities, depression, and\\nattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\\n10.Do not eat artificial sweeteners (including Splenda).\\nArtificial sweeteners are man-made chemicals.

All are excellent choices for sweeteners. Remember,\\nscience is not better than nature.\\n11.Do not drink diet sodas.\\nDiet sodas have been called the \"new crack\" because they are so\\naddicting. Diet sodas will actually make you gain weight as well as\\nmake you depressed. Because of the artificial sweeteners used, such\\nas aspartame, they are also giving you a variety of medical symptoms.\\nIf you want a soda, ideally, get an organic soda from your health food\\nstore. Or if you must indulge, drink a regular soda. If you were to\\nstop drinking all diet sodas and replace them with regular soda, you\\nwould in fact lose weight. The idea that diet sodas have fewer calo-\\nries, thus are good for weight control, is a lie. The exact opposite is\\ntrue. Remember, all carbonated drinks block calcium absorption.\\n12.Do not eat hydrogenated oil.\\nThis is classified as a trans fat. Hydrogenated oils are man-made\\nproducts. They are toxic poisons. More importantly, they attack\\nthe artery walls and cause heart disease. They also attack the liver,\\nspleen, intestine, kidneys, and gallbladder, causing the internal\\norgans to operate much less efficiently. The bad news is that hydro-\\ngenated oil is in virtually every product you buy! The good news is\\nthat if you shop at a health food or whole food store, and if you read\\nthe labels, you can find many of the products you buy now without\\nhydrogenated oil. This is a good example of how medical science\\nsays something is bad, and then later reverses their position. For\\nyears heart patients were told to stay away from butter because it\\nwas bad for your heart. Instead, they were told to use margarine.\\nUnfortunately, most all margarines are 100 percent hydrogenated\\noil. Margarines are man-made unnatural products that are deadly\\npoison to the body. Now we hear from the same doctors and medical\\ncommunity that margarine is, in fact, much worse than butter. Stay\\naway from hydrogenated oils and trans fats at all costs.\\n13.Do not eat homogenized and pasteurized dairy products.\\nAll dairy products are not created equal.

Have you noticed that the same\\nkind of cheese tastes different depending on what part of the coun-\\ntry or world in which it was produced?\\nThere are vast differences in dairy products due to multiple factors.\\nThese differences mean that the dairy products affect the body in\\nvastly different ways. Example: raw milk that has not been pasteur-\\nized or homogenized, that came from a cow that was organically\\nraised, was free-roaming, grass fed, and not given antibiotic or\\ngrowth hormone injections, will affect the body much differently\\nthan milk coming from a genetically modified cow that has been\\ngiven antibiotic and growth hormone injections, never allowed to\\nroam, is fed chemically laced growth enhancing feed, and has been\\npasteurized and homogenized. The problem occurs when studies\\nare conducted and researchers do not use raw organic milk. They\\nuse the chemically laced, pasteurized and homogenized milk. If they\\nwere to conduct the studies comparing organic raw milk versus the\\nsupermarket variety, we would see dramatically different results.\\nThe bottom line here is the standard supermarket variety of milk\\nand dairy products are very unhealthy. Homogenization makes the\\ndairy products scar the arteries in your body and is a leading cause\\nof heart disease. Organic raw, unpasteurized, unhomogenized milk,\\ncheese and dairy products are incredibly healthy. Remember, sci-\\nence is not better than nature. When man gets involved and changes\\nthings from its natural state to increase profits, the food is no longer\\n\"real\"; it becomes a man-made look-alike imitation.\\n14. Do not eat high fructose corn syrup.\\nIf you look at the ingredients of the product you are buying and\\nsee sugar as the number one ingredient, you may be concerned. In\\norder to avoid this, food manufacturers use a variety of sweeteners\\nsuch as sugar, dextrose, fructose, corn syrup solids, corn syrup,\\nhigh fructose corn syrup, multidextrin, and a variety of others. If\\nyou were to add up all of the sugars, in most cases sugar would\\nbe the number one ingredient in most of these kinds of products.\\nHigh fructose corn syrup is used primarily for two reasons. First,\\nit is very inexpensive. Secondly, it makes you fatter than the other\\nsweeteners that could be used. The food industry wants you to be\\nfat.

Real,\\nunprocessed, raw, evaporated cane juice, which is real sugar, is\\ngood for you. White sugar is poison. The chemicals used in the\\ngrowing of sugar cane are known to cause cancer in sea turtles.\\nThose poisonous chemicals used in the growing still remain in the\\nproduct you buy in the store.\\n29.Do not eat white processed flour.\\nWhite processed flour is similar to white sugar. It comes from grain\\nthat has been chemically treated in the growing process, stripped\\nof all its natural fiber and nutrients, and chemically bleached to\\nmake it a pretty white. White flour mixed with water makes paste.\\nYou use it to make papier-mache. It turns hard as a rock. That\\'s\\nwhat happens when you eat it. It is an unnatural product that the\\nbody does not know how to digest. It has little nutritional value,\\nno life force, spikes your insulin, and causes constipation. Use\\norganic whole grain flour that has been minimally processed, or\\nbuy organic grains and grind them yourself.\\n30.Eat nothing that says \"fat free\" on the label.\\nFood companies want you to buy their products. Whatever the hot\\nbutton is at the time will determine what their marketing people\\ndecide goes on the label. \"Fat free\" does not mean \"healthy.\"\\nWhen you see \"fat free\" on the label, be assured that the company\\nis trying to deceive you, so don\\'t buy it. Most fat free products are\\nsimply loaded with unbelievable amounts of sugar and chemicals.\\n31.Eat nothing that says \"sugar free\" on the label.\\nIt if says sugar free on the label there is a good chance the product\\nis laced with artificial sweeteners. Don\\'t buy it.\\n32.Eat nothing that says \"low carbs\" or \"net carbs\" on the label.\\nThis is the current hot button. The biggest scam going now is the\\nterm \"net carbs.\" Manufacturers load up these products with chemi-\\ncals and artificial sweeteners that they claim have negligible results\\non insulin levels, so they do not count these real carbohydrates in\\nthe net carb number.

They are highly processed\\nand should be avoided. There are a few all-raw organic food bars.\\nCheck at your local health food store and read the ingredient list.\\n34.Do not eat diet or protein shakes.\\nLike food bars, these are produced by companies whose goal is to\\nmake them taste great using the cheapest ingredients possible. With\\nrare exception they should be avoided at all costs.\\n35.Stay away from hot tubs, steam rooms and swimming pools.\\nSwimming pools and hot tubs are filled with water that is loaded\\nto excess with chlorine. Chlorine is a deadly poisonous chemi-\\ncal. People think swimming in a pool or relaxing in a hot tub is\\nhealthy. The exact opposite is true. It suppresses your immune\\nsystem, dries your skin, and loads your body with high amounts\\nof chlorine, scarring the arteries and leading to heart disease. The\\nsteam pouring into the steam room is from regular tap water that\\nis loaded with toxic poisons and contaminants. A steam room\\nis, in fact, a poisonous gas chamber and incredibly unhealthy.\\nSwimming is excellent in the ocean or a lake. If you have a pool\\nor hot tub, inquire about a filtration system where no chlorine\\nor chemicals are used. The system that I use employs ozone and\\noxygen to purify the water. No chlorine or chemicals are put into\\nmy pool or hot tub.

Don\\'t\\nbe misled or deceived into thinking things as simple as these are not\\ncures. These things are causing your illness and disease, and eliminat-\\ning them can and does cure disease!\\nC. You must handle and address your nutritional deficiencies.\\nBy now, hopefully you know that you have nutritional deficiencies.\\nVirtually every single person on the planet has nutritional deficiencies\\nto varying degrees. The reason you are nutrient deficient is because\\nthe way the food is grown and processed strips much of the nutritional\\nvalue in the food.\\nVirtually everything that you buy called \"food\" has been dramati-\\ncally depleted of its nutritional value. As I mentioned before in this\\nbook, researchers have shown that you would have to eat over five times\\nas much food as your grandparents just to receive the same nutritional\\nvalue. However, it\\'s worse because we have more toxins in our body;\\ntherefore, we cannot even absorb the little nutrition we are getting\\nfrom our food. Therefore, we are all nutrient deficient. It is also vitally\\nimportant that you totally understand that many, if not all, diseases are\\ncaused at least in part by nutritional deficiencies. The example I gave\\nearlier about the disease of scurvy is a good simple example.\\nScurvy, as I mentioned, is a horrible debilitating disease. However,\\nresearchers have discovered that scurvy is simply caused by a vitamin\\nC deficiency. If you were to eat some oranges, lemons, or limes scurvy\\nwould be cured. Therefore, an orange, lemon, lime, or even simply\\nvitamin C in a capsule is in fact the cure for scurvy. However, as I men-\\ntioned, the FDA has the crazy law that says only a drug can cure, pre-\\nvent, or treat a disease. According to the FDA, oranges, lemons, and\\nlimes, or vitamin C, cannot legally be the cure for scurvy. Even though\\nit is the cure for scurvy, legally it is not the cure for scurvy! I know it\\'s\\ntotally insane; I know it\\'s wrong, but that\\'s how it is. And again, the\\nreason it is that way is because the drug companies want to control\\nanything to do with the treatment of illness and disease. The drug\\ncompanies\\' profits are at stake and they will stop at nothing to protect\\nthose profits. Remember again the millions of dollars politicians make\\nby buying and selling stock, much of which are pharmaceutical stocks\\nbased on what anyone else would call insider information.

If you want to\\nprevent disease and if you want to cure disease you absolutely must\\nhandle your nutritional deficiencies. Again I will tell you drugs and\\nsurgery are not the answer to prevent and cure disease.

So let me give you a list of dos\\nand don\\'ts, which if you do them will handle your nutritional deficien-\\ncies, and for many of you will be the miraculous all-natural cure that\\nyou have been looking for.\\n1.Eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables.\\nYou don\\'t have to be a vegetarian to be healthy. I have never seen\\nany real, convincing evidence that vegetarians are healthier or live\\nlonger than people who eat animal products. However, the healthiest\\npeople absolutely eat a large amount of fresh, organic, raw, uncooked\\nfruits and vegetables. If you were to do just one thing, I would tell you\\nto eat four pieces of fresh fruit per day and two big raw salads full of\\nvegetables. If you changed nothing else in your diet, but just added\\nthose two things, many medical conditions would disappear. Ideally,\\nthe fruits and vegetables should be organic and uncooked, but cooked\\nnon-organic fruits and vegetables are better than none at all.\\n2.Buy a juice machine and use it.\\nAnimals don\\'t own juice machines, but animals have not loaded\\ntheir bodies with the amount of toxins we have. They use their bod-\\nies as they were designed, unlike us, and they eat raw, uncooked\\nfood full of living enzymes and packed with nutrition and life force\\nenergy. Our food supply today is dramatically depleted of vital\\nvitamins and minerals. Organic produce has up to ten times the\\nvitamin and minerals as non-organic, and has none of the poison\\nresidues of the chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides. Even\\nso, because the soil is so depleted, organic produce still has less\\nnutritional value than the same produce had fifty years ago. You\\nwould have to eat ten times the amount of produce today to even\\ncome close to the nutritional value of food fifty years ago. Therefore,\\nit is absolutely impossible to get the amount of vitamins, minerals,\\nand enzymes that you need by simply eating food.

Drinking\\nthree to four glasses of fresh juice gives your body a huge amount\\nof living enzymes, as well as vitamins and minerals in the natural\\nstate and in the proportion that nature intended.\\n3.Eat raw organic nuts and seeds.\\nRaw means uncooked. Stay away from roasted and salted nuts and\\nseeds. Ideally, buy them in the shell, they retain more nutrients.\\nThere is tremendous life force in nuts and seeds. They are great to\\nsnack on throughout the day.\\n4.Get natural sunlight.\\nGo for a walk in the sun! Your body needs sunlight. Do not use\\nsunglasses or sun screens.

What this means is there are nutrients\\nin royal jelly that have not been discovered by science. This is\\nan important point. Remember, science is not better than nature.\\nScience continually thinks that they are smarter than anyone else\\non the planet. Science continually believes that they know all\\nthere is to know about health nutrition or anything for that matter.\\nBut science has yet to discover all of the nutrients that we need for\\nhealth.

This is why eating food in its most\\nnatural raw state is so important.

Increasing\\nthe amount of oxygen in the body to the level where it should be\\nalkalizes the body and creates an environment where disease cannot\\nexist.

Taking digestive enzymes can\\neliminate acid reflux, heartburn, indigestion, gas, bloating, and\\nconstipation. There are many brands available containing a vari-\\nety of ingredients.

Remember\\nthat the research is conclusive that when nutritional deficiencies are\\naddressed many diseases vanish! Remember, the powers that be want\\nyou to believe that you need drugs to cure and prevent disease. This\\nis a great lie. The fact is diseases are not caused by \"lack of drugs.\"\\nRemember, as I said before, you don\\'t have a headache because you have\\nan aspirin deficiency, but you do have a headache because of either tox-\\nins in your body, or a nutritional deficiency, or exposure to electromag-\\nnetic chaos, or mental and emotional stress! Do you understand that the\\nheadache that you have is caused by one, or a combination of, those four\\nthings? It is not caused by an aspirin or drug deficiency! Understand that\\npoint. Imagine the man who walks in the doctor\\'s office and says, \"Every\\ntime I hit my foot with a hammer it hurts. How do I stop the pain?\" The\\nanswer, of course, is \"Stop hitting your foot with a hammer!\"\\nUnfortunately, in today\\'s environment the doctor wouldn\\'t even\\nconsider telling the person to stop hitting his foot with a hammer. The\\nmedical doctor would simply write a prescription for a drug, or cut off\\nthe man\\'s foot. Why? Well as I mentioned, he would do that for two\\nspecific reasons. Number one, he has only been trained on prescribing\\ndrugs and cutting parts of a person\\'s anatomy. Secondly, he has prob-\\nably been given huge cash incentives from the drug companies to pre-\\nscribe drugs, or he needs to make a payment on his yacht and needs\\nthe money that he will get from the insurance company or the govern-\\nment by performing the unnecessary surgery. Please pay attention to\\nthis because this is exactly how doctors operate. This is the insider\\'s\\nsecret that they don\\'t want you to know. I will say it again, and again,\\nand againâdoctors are given cash incentives to prescribe drugs, and\\nthey perform unnecessary surgeries because of the massive amounts\\nof money they get from the insurance companies and the government\\nto do so. It\\'s almost always all about the money. I do, of course, have\\nrespect for those well intentioned medical doctors who are making\\ndecisions based on what they feel is best for the patient.

Can drinking some goji\\njuice or mangosteen juice cure a disease? The answerâabsolutely\\n100 percent yes it can.\\nD. Neutralize electromagnetic chaos\\nAs you now know, electromagnetic chaos causes your body to devel-\\nop disease. We cannot eliminate electromagnetic chaos, but we can\\nreduce our exposure to electromagnetic chaos and there are ways to\\nneutralize electromagnetic chaos. Electromagnetic chaos is power-\\nful and causes disease. Reducing, eliminating, or neutralizing these\\npowerful negative frequencies can and does result in the \"curing\" of\\nsymptoms and disease. I have seen men with erectile dysfunction and\\nprostate cancer be cured by simply stop using laptop computers. Why?\\nBecause in their particular case the powerful wireless devices in the\\nlaptop computers were causing their disease! I\\'ve seen people with\\nmigraine headaches, fatigue, and depression be cured by simply wear-\\ning an electromagnetic chaos eliminator because their diseases and\\nsymptoms were simply caused by sitting in front of a computer screen\\nall day long at work. Cell phones do cause cancer. Laptop computers\\ndo cause cancer. High-definition TVs do cause cancer. Irradiating food\\ndoes cause cancer when eaten. Microwaving food does cause cancer\\nwhen eaten. As a matter of fact, all of these things not only cause can-\\ncer, but suppress the body\\'s immune system and make us susceptible\\nto all kinds of diseases. Of course, the manufacturers of these devices\\ndeny these allegations. However, even in their own literature they\\nstate that there are committees around the world whose CONSENSUS\\nis that these devices appear to be safe! The key is the word \"con-\\nsensus\" and the word \"appear.\" When the word consensus is used\\nit means that there are people who disagree. That means there are\\nscientists and researchers who categorically state that these devices\\ncause disease. Keep in mind that the majority of people on these\\n\"committees\" are actually on the payrolls of the companies on which\\nthey are reporting. There is a major conflict of interest. Remember,\\nit\\'s always all about the money! So let me give you the dos and don\\'ts\\nin relating to electromagnetic chaos.\\n1.

Because of the censorship imposed\\nby our government, it is forbidden for me to tell you the products\\nthat I personally use. However, go to www.naturalcures.com, and\\nin the private member area you can e-mail me and I will tell you\\nwhat I use and where to obtain them. They are inexpensive and\\nwork brilliantly.\\n2.Use electronic and wireless devices less.\\nIt appears that some of the most negative effects of electromagnetic\\nenergy comes from wireless devices such as cell phones, laptop\\ncomputers, as well as high-definition TVs. I know it's impossible to\\neliminate the use of these devices; however, you should at least be\\naware of their powerful adverse effects and limit their use as best\\nyou can.\\n3.Use a gentle wind project instrument.\\nOur energy fields get damaged due to traumas in our life, all the\\nunnatural man-made electromagnetic frequencies that are bom-\\nbarding us, and toxic material we put in our body. This energy field\\nneeds to be repaired and balanced, and then maintained on a regular\\nbasis. The Gentle Wind Project produces healing instruments that\\nare believed to repair and positively influence this field. Although\\nthese healing instruments are expensive, you may use one for free.\\nThe best part is it takes only five minutes and all you do is hold the\\ninstrument in your hand.

High\\ndefinition televisions produce such powerful negative electromag-\\nnetic energy they have wiped out entire computer networks when\\nturned on.

Today the earth\\'s gauss is .04. Sleeping on a mattress pad\\nfilled with magnets stimulates energy flowing through the body as\\nnature intended. It has been said to alleviate pain, slow the aging\\nprocess, increase energy, and helps alkalize the body. There are\\nmany good pads on the market. For my personal recommenda-\\ntions, go to www.naturalcures.com.\\n6.Use magnetic finger and toe rings.\\nThese are inexpensive and easy to use. Simply wear this specially\\ndesigned magnetic ring on the small finger of each hand, and if you\\nwant even more benefit, wear the toe brace on each foot. These\\nare worn when you sleep. The health benefits seem to be almost\\nunbelievable.

Do this experiment: Go to a laun-\\ndromat and sit in front of all the tumble dryers in operation, and\\nnotice how you feel after just thirty minutes.

For many of you the reason that you have\\nsymptoms, disease, fatigue, and illness is not one specific thing but a\\ncombination of things. That is why it is important to do as many of\\nthese things as you can and understand your disease did not develop\\novernight, your condition did not magically appear, but your condition\\nwas developing for years and years before you noticed any symptoms.\\nIt is important for you to know that your condition is not going to\\nreverse, in most cases, overnight, but it absolutely can be cured with-\\nout drugs and without surgery, with the exception being of course if\\nyou are past that point of no return.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

You must reduce stress.\\nStress is the silent killer. Mental and emotional stress affects every cell\\nin the body. The mind can turn the body\\'s pH from acidic to alkaline in\\na matter of minutes. Stress can adversely affect the genetic makeup in\\nyour body; the mind can positively or negatively affect DNA. What you\\nsay and how you think can absolutely give you disease and it can abso-\\nlutely cure you of disease. If you want to prevent disease, be happy,\\neliminate depression and fatigue, and cure any disease you have, you\\nabsolutely categorically must reduce stress that is in your body. It is\\nimpossible to say \"eliminate all stress,\" but you certainly can reduce\\nstress. Can simply eliminating stress cure a disease you may have? The\\nanswer: absolutely, 100 percent yes. Health-care practitioners around\\nthe world have proven over and over again that by simply reducing\\nstress diseases are cured. Even medical doctors cannot deny the power\\nof the mind in healing the body. The placebo affect has been proven by\\neven the pharmaceutical industry! The placebo affect has shown that\\nup to 40 percent of people cure themselves with nothing more than\\nthoughts. That comes directly from the pharmaceutical industry\\'s own\\nliterature. That is a natural cure they don\\'t want you to know about.\\nSo let me give you a list of what I think are the most powerful ways to\\nreduce stress. Keep in mind that even if you did just one of these things\\nit could be the cure for your disease. I recommend, as always, do as\\nmany of these as you can, and start doing these things as soon as you\\ncan, and do them as often as you can! You need to reduce stress in your\\nlife to live a long, happy, healthy, disease-free life. Most importantly, if\\nyou have illness and disease now, you absolutely categorically need to\\nreduce stress if you intend on curing your disease.\\n1. Listen to de-stressing CDs.\\nIf there is one thing that I could recommend to help you eliminate\\nstress it would be to listen to stress reducing CDs. You need head-\\nphones when you use this specially created music, and in some\\ncases words, that are designed to stimulate the brain, release heal-\\ning hormones, and dramatically release stress that has been frozen\\nand encapsulated in the body. PH levels in the body can be radically\\nchanged in a matter of minutes with these powerful tools. The most\\nsuccessful practitioner of this kind of technique is Dr. Coldwell of\\nGermany.

The interesting thing to note about the fact that we are so\\noverweight in America is that we are doing more to lose weight, yet\\nwe continue to get fatter.

As I mentioned earlier\\nin the book, when experts state things they always state them as fact\\nwhen, in reality, they are simply their opinions. What the federal agen-\\ncies state concerning obesity has constantly changed over the years.\\nYears ago the standard party line was the four basic food groups:\\nmeat, dairy, grains, and fruits and vegetables. No one really ques-\\ntioned where the four basic food groups came from, but I saw a poster\\nthat was put up in the schools back in the sixties and had noted on\\nthe bottom that the poster was, in fact, sponsored by the American\\nDairy Association. No wonder dairy products had their own exclusive\\nfood group. Isn\\'t it surprising that the dairy association, whose only\\nobjective is to increase the consumption of dairy products, would\\nstrategically put in schools a poster brainwashing kids into believing\\nthat in order to be healthy they had to eat dairy products at every\\nsingle meal? It goes back to \"It\\'s all about the money.\"\\nThe party line for obesity has always been \"If you want to lose\\nweight you must eat fewer calories and exercise more.\" However, there\\nare experts who present information as fact that will tell you that calo-\\nries are not the issue at all, and you must reduce the amount of fat you\\nconsume if you want to lose weight. But there are other experts with\\njust as much scientific proof that claim that fat is not the issue at all; the\\nreal culprit is carbohydrates, and if you want to lose weight you must\\nreduce the amount of carbohydrates you consume. Yet another group\\nof experts, with their stacks of scientific documentation, proclaim that\\nfood combining is the secret to losing weight and keeping it off forever.\\nHowever, there is a list of experts lined up, each holding a stack of\\nresearch documents, scientific proof espousing their fact about losing\\nweight: the glycemic index, insulin secretion, hormonal imbalances,\\ngenetics...the list goes on.\\nAs I said in the beginning of the book, no one really knows anything\\nwhen it comes to medicine, health, disease, illness, sickness, or obesity.\\nWe all look at studies, general observations, personal experience, anec-\\ndotes from other people\\'s lives, and come up with conclusions that we\\nthink make the best sense.

However, as more informa-\\ntion becomes available this information may be altered, changed, or\\n`improved\\'.\" With that said, let\\'s look at something we all know is true.\\nEveryone reading this knows a person who does not exercise, who\\neats huge amounts of food, including the so-called fattening foods like\\npizza, pasta, ice cream, cookies, cakesâyou name it, they eat it. We\\nall know of a person who falls into this category, yet is as skinny as a\\nrail and never gains a pound. I have a personal experience regarding\\nthis. When I grew up my brother could eat anything he wanted, any\\ntype of food, any amount, at any time of the day, and he never gained\\nany weight. If I followed my brother and ate the same amount of food\\nthat he did, and did exactly the same things he did in terms of exer-\\ncise, I would have blown up to 300 pounds.\\nSo it appears that some people\\'s bodies are genetically designed\\nto be thin, while other people\\'s bodies are genetically designed to be\\nfatter. At least that is how it appears. However, I was looking through\\nhistory books about Nazi concentration camps in World War II and I\\nnoticed that the people behind the barbed wire, who were in the con-\\ncentration camps, were all skinny. There weren\\'t any fat people there.\\nI thought to myself, \"I wonder if some of those people were genetically\\ndisposed to be thin and others were genetically disposed to be fat.\"\\nWhen they came out of the concentration camps and went back to\\ntheir normal routines, I wondered if some of those people remained\\nthin and other people, because of genetic disposition, got fatter.

Most fat people have a low metabolism.\\nWhat does this mean? This means you can eat some food and even\\nif you eat a small amount your body doesn\\'t burn it off very quickly\\nand, instead, turns it into fat in your body. If you had a really high\\nmetabolism you could eat large amounts of food and it wouldn\\'t\\nturn to fat in your body. So the number one reason a person is fat is\\nbecause of a low metabolism.\\nWhy is this so specific to America, as opposed to other countries?\\nI will explain. But first, what exactly is metabolism? In simple\\nterms, there are certain organs and glands in the body which regu-\\nlate how your body burns food for fuel and how it converts food\\ninto fat. These include the thyroid, pancreas, liver, stomach, small\\nand large intestines, and colon. When you have a slow metabolism,\\nthere is a good chance that some of these organs and glands are\\nnot working at optimal levels. Always remember, if you find a prob-\\nlem in the body where the body is not operating as it is supposed\\nto, you have to ask the question, \"What caused that not to operate\\nproperly?\" You always have to look for the cause first. There are\\nmany causes for low metabolism, including yo-yo dieting. If you\\nhave repeatedly lost weight and gained weight I can tell you that\\nyour body metabolism is all screwed up.\\nSo, let\\'s look at each one of these reasons, and find out what\\ncaused the malfunction.\\nâ¢ Most Fat People Have an Underactive Thyroid.\\nIf you have an underactive thyroid, called a hypoactive thyroid,\\nyour body\\'s ability to convert food to energy is slow and you have\\na higher chance of having food that you eat turn to fat in the\\nbody. What is number one cause of a hypoactive thyroid? No one\\nknows. Remember, I will always say that no one really knows. I\\nwill always say it appears, or it seems, or we believe based on\\nthe information we have right now. The answer is really that it\\nappears that one contributing factor to a hypoactive thyroid is\\nthe fluoride in the water that you drink. Fluoride is not put in\\ndrinking water in other countries. This is one of the reasons why\\nAmericans have such a high propensity for an under active thy-\\nroid and a low metabolism and being overweight.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

There is no one\\nitem that is the cause of obesity in America. It is a combination\\nof things, and a number of things that appear to be the reason\\nthat we appear to be so fat.\\nâ¢Most Fat People Have a Pancreas that Does Not Work\\nProperly.\\nThe pancreas secretes insulin. Fat people appear to have a pan-\\ncreas that secretes insulin at a much faster rate than thin peo-\\nple. A fat person's pancreas also secretes more insulin than that\\nof a thin person. What causes your pancreas to secrete more\\ninsulin at a faster rate? The answer: No one really knows. But\\nbased on the information that we have, it appears to be some of\\nthe food additives that are in the food served in America. Many\\nof these food additives are not put in food in other countries. It\\nalso appears that the high amounts of refined sugar cause this\\npancreas problem as well. American food has more processed\\nsugar than food from other countries.\\nâ¢Most Fat People Have a Clogged and Sluggish Liver.\\nThe liver is a detoxifying organ. When it's clogged up, your\\nmetabolism slows down. What causes the clogging up of the\\nliver? The number one reason your liver is clogged and not\\noperating properly is the nonprescription over-the-counter\\ndrugs you have taken your entire life, and all the prescription\\ndrugs you have taken. Most notably, if you take any cholesterol\\nreducing drugs, your liver is absolutely categorically clogged.\\nChlorine and fluoride in the water is another cause of a clogged\\nliver. Food additives used in processed food and fast food dra-\\nmatically clog the liver. Refined sugar and white flour clog the\\nliver. Substances such as artificial sweeteners, monosodium\\nglutamate, and preservatives all clog the liver. The bottom line\\nis the pharmaceutical companies clog your liver and the pub-\\nlicly traded food industry clogs your liver!\\nâ¢Most Fat People Have A Sluggish Digestive System\\n(Stomach, Small And Large Intestine).\\nOverweight people seem to have a problem with producing diges-\\ntive enzymes.

If you have\\never taken just one antibiotic in your life, that antibiotic killed all\\nof the friendly flora in your intestine and allowed for candida to\\nrun rampant, infesting your small and large intestine and colon,\\npermeating the cell walls, and slowing down your digestion and\\nelimination.\\nSo, if we were to ask what is the number one reason for a slow\\nmetabolism, the answer is \"What you put in your body.\" The\\npoisons that you put in your body affect your metabolism.\\nThese poisons or toxins include nonprescription and prescrip-\\ntion drugs, chemical residue used in the growing of food, the\\nartificial food additives used by manufacturers, and the toxins\\nin our water supply, primarily chlorine and fluoride.\\nThere is another major reason why your metabolism is low.\\nThis has to do with exercise. The more muscle you have, the\\nhigher your metabolism. Most Americans have an abnormally\\nlow amount of muscle in their body. This means you do not\\nburn calories as effectively as you could. The second most\\nimportant issue in relation to exercise is lack of walking. The\\nhuman body is designed to walk. An interesting study of thin\\nEuropeans, Africans, Chinese, and South Americans shows\\nthat the common denominator of thin, lean people is the\\namount of walking they do on a daily basis.

Another reason that\\nyou are hungry is that certain common food additives actually\\nincrease your hunger.\\n4.Most fat people have hormonal imbalances.\\nIf you are overweight statistics show that there is a high probability\\nthat your body is secreting too much of certain hormones and not\\nenough of others.

Ideally done on a daily basis.\\n10.Eat organic grapefruits all day.\\nRemember the grapefruit diet? Well, it appears that there actually is\\nan enzyme in grapefruits that burns fat. Eating grapefruits all day, as\\nmany and as often as you desire, will speed the fat burning process.\\n11.Absolutely no aspartame or any artificial sweeteners.\\nAspartame, which goes by the name NutraSweetÂ®, will make you\\nfat. All other artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, SplendaÂ®, or\\nanything else, should be avoided. If you want the full story, read two\\nbooks: Aspartame: Is it Safe? and Excitotoxins: The Taste that Kills.\\n12.Absolutely no monosodium glutamate (MSG).\\nMSG is an excitotoxin. It makes you fat, causes all kinds of medical\\nproblems, and can affect your mood making you depressed. It also can\\nbe physically addicting, like aspartame, and actually make you hun-\\ngrier. Unfortunately, the food industry has lobbied Congress to pass\\nlaws allowing monosodium glutamate to be put in the food and not be\\nlisted on the label. There are dozens of words that can be on the label\\nsuch as spices, artificial flavoring, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, etc.,\\nthat are in fact MSG in disguise.\\nThis is why I recommend buying organic food, where everything\\nlisted in the ingredient list is something you recognize and can pro-\\nnounce. Also, MSG is in virtually all fast food, including things you\\nwould never imagine, such as pizza. This is why people in foreign\\ncountries eat all kinds of food and never get fat. It's not so much the\\nfood, but the ingredients used in American food processing.\\n13.Take digestive enzymes.\\nIf you are overweight there is an excellent chance your body is\\nnot producing enough digestive enzymes, causing you to gain\\nweight, feel bloated, have gas, indigestion, and constipation.

I did an\\ninteresting experiment with people who drank diet sodas on a regular\\nbasis. For two weeks they replaced their diet soda with regular high-\\ncalorie sugar sweetened soda. Amazingly, no one gained any weight.\\nEven more shocking was 80 percent of the people actually lost weight.\\nOne person lost seven pounds! This was stunning to me. Diet foods fall\\ninto the same category. Do not eat anything that is being presented as a\\ndiet food. They are loaded with ingredients that will actually make you\\nfatter and make you physically addicted.\\n15.No fast food or chain restaurants.\\nAny restaurant that is a chain or a franchise that sells fast food pro-\\nduces their food in such a way that it will absolutely make you fat.\\nYou can actually eat french fries and cheeseburgers and lose weight,\\nprovided that the ingredients that you use are all organic and contain\\nno chemical additives. It is virtually impossible to eat food in a chain\\nor franchise restaurant where the food has not been processed to last\\nfor years without spoiling. The food has to be produced as cheaply as\\npossible for the companies to make money. They must add chemicals\\nto make the food taste great and get you physically addicted. This food\\nalso has been produced to increase your appetite and make you fat-\\nter. Remember, these are businesses whose only objective is to make\\na profit. If the food tastes amazing, becomes physically addicting,\\nincreases your appetite, and makes you fat, the restaurant is assured\\nof success.

Apples\\nare loaded with fiber and nutrients; they normalize your blood sugar\\nand decrease your appetite. You should eat at least one apple every\\nday.

The dairy products should be labeled \"organic and\\nraw.\" It may be hard to find raw dairy products in some parts of the\\ncountry. The next best option is organic, not homogenized, but that\\nhas been pasteurized. Your last option is organic that has been both\\npasteurized and homogenized. Ideally, if you want to lose weight,\\nreduce dairy regardless of what you are getting.

I\\'ll give\\nyou some rules, and then I\\'ll actually show you how to read the food\\nlabels and give you some examples.\\nThe basic rule is when you go shopping, do not go to a supermarket.\\nMajor supermarkets are in business to make money. There is virtually\\nnothing in a supermarket that is not loaded with toxins, stripped of nutri-\\ntion, and altered energetically. When you go shopping for food, go to a\\nfarmer\\'s market and buy organic fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices\\nfrom small independent growers that you can talk to, meet and feel con-\\nfident that what you are eating is good for you. You can plant your own\\nherb garden or small vegetable garden. Remember, do not use hybrid\\nseeds because that\\'s a nice way of saying \"genetically altered by man.\"\\nThe most convenient way to shop for food is go to your local whole\\nfood or natural health food type store. Keep in mind, when you go\\nto a health food store or an all-natural whole food type of store, that\\nnot everything in there is perfectly 100 percent okay. Remember, it\\'s\\nalways all about the money. These stores, in some cases, are also pub-\\nlicly traded companies that have to make a profit, so you must read\\nthe labels. When you go to these kinds of stores, however, you have\\nan excellent chance of finding things that are not loaded with toxins,\\nare packed full of nutrition, and have not been energetically altered,\\nunlike a regular supermarket where you virtually have no chance of\\nfinding any food that is not poisonous. The key to reading labels is\\nnot to read the front of the package. This is where the company does\\nits advertising. It has its beautiful pictures, its nice names, attractive\\ncolors, and all the buzz-word phrases that the marketing department\\nhas spent millions of dollars researching that will make you think it is\\nhealthy and make you buy it. Take the box, or package, or can, or jar,\\nand look for the ingredients. Keep in mind that there can be thousands', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The bigger the food manufacturer and\\nthe bigger the name brand, the higher chance that it is loaded with\\nchemicals that are not listed. My first general rule: When shopping,\\ndon\\'t go to a supermarket. Go to a health food store, a whole food\\nstore, or a farmer\\'s market.\\nMy second rule is: I never buy anything that is a brand name or\\nproduced by large publicly traded food manufacturers. I have been in\\nthese plants and I know what it\\'s all about.\\nMy third rule is: I look for small, independent companies from my\\nlocal area that package food in small batches and make it with loving\\ncare. Although these people are in business to make a profit, when\\nmeeting them you find their prime motivation is not to get rich or\\nmake money. Their prime motivation is to provide an excellent qual-\\nity product for their community.\\nMy next rule is that I always, always, always, always, always read\\nthe ingredient list. I know there are certain things that, if they appear\\nin the ingredient list, I immediately put the box down. Let me give you\\nthe most important words you should look for on the ingredient list,\\nand if you see them absolutely do not buy the product.\\n1.Anything You Can\\'t Pronounce\\nThis is really easy. If you can\\'t pronounce the word, don\\'t buy itâit\\'s\\na chemical. They can call it anything they want, they can say it\\'s\\nnaturally derived, or that it comes from a plant, or that it\\'s all-natu-\\nral. None of this is true. Keep in mind that food manufacturers lobby\\nCongress through virtual payoffs and bribes to get legislation allowing\\nfood manufactures to call chemicals \"all-natural ingredients.\" So the\\nbottom line is, if you can\\'t pronounce it, don\\'t buy it.\\n2.Monosodium Glutamate\\nNever buy anything with monosodium glutamate in it. If you\\'re not\\nconvinced, read the book Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills. MSG is an\\nexcitotoxin. It is dangerous and deadly; it makes you fat, increases your\\nappetite, and causes all types of physical and medical problems.\\n3.Aspartame\\nThis is also an excitotoxin. It makes you fat, it makes you hungry, it\\nmakes you depressed, and it leads to all types of medical conditions,\\nincluding PMS and migraines.

Much of\\nthe food in today\\'s high-tech processing loses most of its nutritional\\nvalue, is energetically altered, and virtually tastes like nothing. Food\\nmanufacturers then must add chemicals to make the food taste like it\\'s\\nsupposed to taste.\\nImagine buying an apple, eating it blindfolded, and not knowing\\nwhat fruit it is. Imagine food manufacturers having to inject the apple\\nwith chemicals so that the apple actually tastes like an apple again.\\nThat is actually happening today. The reason the apple doesn\\'t taste\\nlike an apple is because the growers have depleted the soil so much\\nover the years, used so much chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and her-\\nbicides, and the food has been irradiated by some of the most power-\\nful electromagnetic energy known to man, that the final product, the\\napple, no longer has any flavor. Compare this to an organic apple that\\nactually tastes like an apple. Just because it says \"natural flavors\"\\ndoesn\\'t mean it\\'s natural. The food industry has lobbied Congress to\\npass legislation allowing chemicals that are not natural at all to be\\ncalled \"natural flavors.\" This is fraud.\\nHowever, this is what\\'s going on. Artificial flavors are treated the\\nsame way. When you see the word \"natural flavors\" or \"artificial fla-\\nvors,\" if you were to ask the food company to individually list the\\nnatural and artificial flavors, they would absolutely refuse. My insiders\\ntell me that if they were to list the natural or artificial flavors used, the\\nlist could run to hundreds of chemicals put into that food under term\\n\"natural flavors\" or \"artificial flavors.\" The other major problem with\\nchemical additives in the food is a single chemical may not have major\\nimmediate negative effects. But when you combine two or three chemi-\\ncals together, just like in chemistry class, new chemicals are formed.\\nScientists at the food companies know this. What these new chemicals\\ndo is incredibly dangerous and incredibly powerfulâso stay away.\\n8. Spices\\nThis is the other great fraud that the food industry is perpetrating on\\nthe American public. Spices sound wonderful and healthy, but they\\nare not. The food industry has lobbied Congress to pass legislation\\nallowing chemicals to be called spices. They are not spices. They are\\nman-made, deadly chemicals, but legally they can be called spices.\\nWhen you ask what spices they use, they won\\'t tell you.

The reason is that in the processing of soy protein isolate,\\nhexane is often used, which is a petroleum solvent similar to gasoline.\\nCertainly these chemicals, or residues of these chemicals, remain in\\nthe food, but they are never listed on the label.\\nThese are the main things to stay away from, but the good rule\\nof thumb is to simply read the label. If the ingredients are not things\\nthat you could have in your own kitchen or if the food is something\\nyou couldn't make yourself, stay away from itâit's man-made and it\\nis dangerous. In an ideal world you would make your own food from\\nscratch. It tastes better, you don't feel bad after eating it, your energy\\nlevels stay high, and you don't get depressed or constipated or have gas\\nand bloating.\\nA good example is ice cream. I have an ice cream maker in my\\nhouse. I make ice cream every so often for myself, or when I'm hav-\\ning friends over. I buy raw, organic milk and cream made from cows\\nthat are grass fed. Remember, raw means the milk and cream have\\nnot been pasteurized or homogenized; it has no pesticides or antibiot-\\nics, and is incredibly pure and healthy. For a sweetener I use whole\\norganic sugar, which has never been separated or bleached, or I use\\norganic maple syrup. Depending upon the kind of ice cream I'm mak-\\ning, I may use organic vanilla beans, organic strawberries or blueber-\\nries, organic chocolate, organic nuts like walnuts, and maybe a pinch\\nof organic sea salt. That's it. One of my favorite ice creams is maple-\\nwalnut, and it is also the simplest. I simply follow the recipe and use\\nthe milk and cream, a pinch of organic sea salt, organic maple syrup,\\nand some crushed-up organic walnuts. When people eat this they all\\nsay it is the best ice cream they have ever eaten. Well, not only is it\\nthe best tasting, but it is also the healthiest. People forget how much\\nfun it is for the entire family to spend time in the kitchen adding love\\nto the food that you eat. Buying food already prepackaged and made\\nby major food companies means you are buying food where no love\\nhas been added. The energy a person adds to food by preparing it\\nhimself actually causes the electrons in the food to spin in different\\ndirections, causing a much healthier product for the body.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Keep in mind that these products are almost identical, but\\nthe basic differences are these: The food from the health food store\\nwill have fewer ingredients, the ingredients will be organic, and there\\nwill be virtually no chemicals in the food at all. The food has not been\\nprocessed so it has not been stripped of all its nutritional value, and\\nit has not been energetically destroyed in the processing plants of the\\nmajor food producers. The food from the health food store also tastes\\nbetter because it is made with whole food ingredients. When you eat\\nit you do not feel bad, you do not get constipation, bloating, or gas.\\nMost people eat less because of the incredible increase in nutrition\\nand, because it is assimilated into the body so much easier, you don\\'t\\ncrave as much. Keep in mind, most food producers want you to crave\\ntheir food and eat more. That\\'s how they make more money.

A restaurant is not\\na restaurant is not a restaurant. There are vast differences between\\nthe kinds of restaurants you go to. I\\'m not talking about the food, I\\'m\\ntalking about the kind of restaurant. Virtually all restaurants have the\\nfollowing problems:\\nIn order to make a profit they have to buy the cheapest food avail-\\nable. Restaurants get their food primarily from large, bulk food suppli-\\ners that supply hundreds of restaurants in a given area. Much of the\\nfood you eat in any restaurant has not been cooked at the restaurant;\\nrather, it has simply been finished off or heated up. It gets worse with\\nrestaurants that are vast in number, such as franchises, chains and\\nfast food. Most restaurants use microwave ovens to reheat the food\\nright before serving. Most restaurants, like large food manufacturers,\\nuse frying oil all day and, in many cases, for days on end. The problem\\nwith this is once you heat the oil for frying it goes rancid in a very\\nshort period of time. All the food coming out of the rancid oil is highly\\ncarcinogenic.\\nI went into a very nice restaurant and was about to order, but\\nwanted to ask some questions. I love fresh guacamole. I make it at my\\nhouse with all raw organic ingredients and it is absolutely delicious.\\nI saw they had guacamole on the menu so I inquired, was the guaca-\\nmole made fresh? The waiter told me yes. I inquired a little further.

When I asked what the ingredients of the mix were,\\nof course he didn\\'t know. I persuaded him to go and find the package\\nand bring me the ingredient list. There are over three dozen ingredi-\\nents on the label, including monosodium glutamate.\\nI asked if the salad was fresh. He thought for a moment and said\\n\"No. It actually comes in bags that have been prepackaged.\" The prob-\\nlem with this, of course, is that in order to retain freshness the \"fresh\\nsalad\" has to be sprayed with chemicals. I asked if the chicken was\\nfresh, or did it come prepackaged and frozen. Not surprisingly, it came\\nprepackaged and frozen. Virtually all the sauces, all the mixes, and all\\nthe flavoring agents used came in boxes, cans, or packages. This is the\\nmain problem with restaurant food.\\nSo, what do you do? Basically, you can be a fanatic and not eat\\nin any restaurant unless it\\'s an all-natural, totally organic restaurant,\\nor you can simply eat really well at home and stay away from chains,\\nfranchises, and fast food as best you can. When you go to a good qual-\\nity restaurant, simply ask if you can tour the kitchen and see some of\\nthe food being prepared. Most managers welcome this. It will give you\\na chance to meet the manager and/or the owner and inquire about\\nhow the different dishes are made. You can then see which one would\\nbe using the highest quality and the freshest ingredients. You can also\\nsimply ask to eliminate things. Example: I happen to like fried chick-\\nen wings. I make them at home myself, my mother taught me how. We\\ntake organic chicken wings, lightly dust them in organic whole wheat\\nflour with sea salt and organic black pepper, and gently fry them in a\\nlittle bit of extra virgin organic olive oil. They are absolutely delicious.\\nWhen I go to a restaurant, I know that most chicken wings are pur-\\nchased pre-made and pre-breaded, and are simply thrown into rancid\\noil in a fryer in the back, then smothered in a sauce, all of which con-\\ntain massive amounts of monosodium glutamate. Therefore, I don\\'t\\neat chicken wings in restaurants. So basically, I ask a few questions\\nand make some intelligent choices. And remember, you have to care,\\nbut not THAT much. You have to do what you feel good about and\\nhappy about and not be stressed out about your decisions.\\nI have a close friend who is not only a vegetarian, but eats only\\nraw, uncooked food. She is not stressed out or fanatical about it, that\\'s\\njust what she eats. We went to a restaurant and I ordered some salmon\\nsushi.

A study showed that mobile phones emanate\\nradio waves that definitely damage the cells in the body, as\\nwell as DNA. Most shocking was the fact that the damage\\nextended to the next generation of cells as well. The Cellular\\nTelecommunications & Internet Association hired a man to\\nhead up a $28 million research program looking into the\\npossible health effects from cellular phone use. Amazingly,\\nthe industry\\'s own research showed that heavy cell phone\\nusers experience an increase rate of brain cancer deaths,\\ndevelopment of tumors, genetic damage in the cells, as well\\nas other negative health issues.\\n32.

I would encourage you to get advice\\nfrom licensed health-care practitioners who do not use drugs and sur-\\ngery. I would encourage you to get three or four different opinions.\\nThis way you can make a proper informed decision.

The fact of the matter is they are\\nimportant, but not very important when compared to the chemicals\\nand poisons put into the food. What is more important than calories\\nor fats and carbohydrates is the chemical fertilizers used in the food,\\nthe pesticides used in the food, the fact that the food is picked early\\nand then gassed, the fact that the food is genetically modified and\\nmanufactured in an unnatural way, the processing methods that are\\nused, the irradiation that was used, the actual thousands of chemicals\\nthat are put in processed food to make it taste better and give it certain\\ntextures, preserve it, or specifically designed to get you chemically and\\nphysically addicted to the food, increase your appetite and make you\\nfat.

These voices, however, are virtu-\\nally never heard. The news media, on television, radio, newspapers,\\nand magazines, suppress their voices. Publishers will not publish their\\nbooks. Only with the Internet are we beginning to hear this huge, sti-\\nfled, and suppressed collective voice. My publishing company, Alliance\\nPublishing Group, Inc., will now be a leading publisher in getting this\\nmessage out. As a publishing company, I am putting much of my for-\\ntune into promoting authors whose voices have been suppressed up\\nuntil now. Hopefully you will see Alliance Publishing produce dozens\\nof books from other authors around the world sharing more about this\\nsubject.\\nQuestion: How come I never really hear about any of this stuff on TV or\\nradio, or read about it in the newspapers and magazines?\\nAnswer: As I mentioned, newspapers, magazines, radio, and television\\nare outlets that are publicly traded corporations.

A person can be very fit, but very unhealthy. Jim Fixx\\nwas a well-known runner who wrote a book called The Complete Book\\nof Running. He dropped dead of a heart attack. He was very fit, but\\nvery unhealthy. There are other people who are unfit, they may be\\nslightly overweight, they may not be very strong or flexible, yet are\\nincredibly healthy and live to be well over 100 years old. Generally\\nspeaking, there is a balance between fitness and health. In order to\\nbe very healthy you have to be at least moderately fit; but you can be\\nincredibly fit and still be very, very unhealthy, get many diseases, and\\ndie young. It is more important to be healthy than fit, but for those\\nwho want to look good in front of a mirror or in a bathing suit, being fit\\nis more important. I believe in a balance between fitness and health,\\nwith health taking the number-one priority. If health is your number-\\none priority, your fitness level will probably be better than the vast\\nmajority of the population anyway.\\nQuestion: You mention lots of products that I should get, such as colon\\ncleansers, water filters, shower filters, electromagnetic chaos elimina-\\ntors, air cleaners, etc. How do I know which products are good and\\nbad?\\nAnswer: The Federal Trade Commission has, in my opinion, com-\\npletely stripped me of my First Amendment right to free speech. Keep\\nin mind I do not sell any products, I am not compensated in any way\\non the sale of any products, but yet the Federal Trade Commission has\\nsaid that if I mention a product by brand name in this book they will\\nin effect confiscate my books, probably burn the books, and probably\\narrest me as well. I wouldn't be surprised if they charged me criminally\\nwith something. The FTC is on an absolute mission to put me in jail, dis-\\ncredit me, and get me out of their hair.

The money\\nis only being used to find a PATENTABLE DRUG or PATENTABLE\\nMEDICAL PROCEDURE that can be used in the TREATMENT of the\\ndisease! Researchers are not looking at the cause, and they are not\\nlooking at ways to prevent disease. They are only trying to find a pat-\\nentable product that can be used to TREAT the disease! They are not\\nlooking for a cure. All the research being funded and done is so that\\nthe drug companies can own the patent on a product, sell it, and make\\nbillions of dollars in profits. There is absolutely no research being done\\non the real causes of disease. There is absolutely no research being\\ndone on any non-patentable natural method to prevent, treat, or cure\\ndisease! Never give money to anybody who is going to do \"research\"\\nfor medical purposes. You are only giving more money to the drug\\ncompanies!\\nQuestion: Are all medical doctors bad and evil?\\nAnswer: No. I believe most people who got into the medical profession\\nsincerely and genuinely wanted to help people. The problem is once\\nyou go to medical school you are in effect being trained by the drug\\nindustry. The only thing you are being taught is the use of drugs and\\nsurgery. You get virtually no training in the true cause of disease; you\\nget virtually no training in how toxins cause disease and drugs cause\\ndisease; you get virtually no training in how nutritional deficiencies\\ncause disease; you get virtually no training in any method of the pre-\\nvention or treatment of disease other than drugs or surgery. You have\\nno information on essential oils or homeopathy. As a matter of fact, as\\na member of the American Medical Association, you are FORBIDDEN\\nby its charter to use anything other than drugs and surgery! Once\\nyou are a medical doctor and a member of the AMA you cannot use\\nhomeopathic remedies, or essential oils, or any natural method to\\ntreat a patient!

It is\\nimportant to know that the liver is the major fat burning organ in the\\nbody. The liver is the only organ that can pump fat out of the body,\\nand the liver is the filter and cleanser of the bloodstream. Every single\\nperson, in my opinion, has a sluggish liver. If your liver is sluggish you\\ncannot burn fat properly, you cannot get fat out of the body properly,\\nand you cannot filter and clean your blood properly. Therefore, if you\\nhave a sluggish liver you are absolutely guaranteeing yourself illness\\nand disease. Your liver is sluggish because of all the chemicals and tox-\\nins in the food that you eat, and all the nonprescription and prescrip-\\ntion drugs. Most notably, if you are on cholesterol-reducing drugs, you\\nabsolutely have a sluggish liver. If you have ever taken an antibiotic in\\nyour life, the antibiotic has killed the friendly flora in your intestine,\\ncausing a Candida yeast overgrowth, which always goes and attacks\\nthe liver. When you do a liver cleanse, almost everyone feels so much\\nbetter they can\\'t believe the difference.\\nQuestion: Is fast food really that bad?\\nAnswer: Fast food categorically, 100 percent, causes illness and dis-\\nease, including cancer, diabetes, and a host of other major health\\nproblems. Fast food categorically makes you fat. Fast food is purpose-\\nly produced with chemical additives that are designed specifically to\\nincrease your appetite, get you physically and chemically addicted to\\ntheir food, and make you fat. The fast-food industry is in effect causing\\nillness and disease, and knowingly doing so. Lawyers for McDonald\\'s\\nstate that the dangers of its food are universally known! McDonald\\'s\\nitself stated in legal papers that it\\'s a matter of common knowledge\\nthat any processing that its foods undergo serve to make them more\\nharmful than unprocessed foods! An example is McNuggets. These\\nwere originally made from old chickens that could no longer lay eggs.\\nNow they are made from chickens that have unusually large breasts,\\na kind of genetically altered and produced animal. The manufacturing\\nprocess includes stripping the meat from the bone and grinding it up\\nin a sort of mash. It is then combined with a host of preservatives,\\nstabilizers, and other chemicals, pressed into shapes, breaded, deep\\n-ried, freeze-dried, and then shipped to McDonald\\'s.

It is available on DVD. This is absolutely a\\nmust watch by every person who eats at fast-food restaurants. In this\\ndocumentary one of the most amazing things was examined. What if\\na person ate only McDonald\\'s food for thirty days? What would hap-\\npen? Could just thirty days of eating McDonald\\'s food cause any medi-\\ncal problem? Could just thirty days of eating McDonald\\'s food cause\\na massive weight gain? Could just thirty days of eating McDonald\\'s\\nfood cause disease and illness? Certainly no doctor would believe that\\nsimply eating McDonald\\'s food for thirty days would cause any medi-\\ncal or health problems. This documentary shows the truth. The man\\nhad his blood work tested before, during, and after his experiment. He\\nhad his weight checked. In just thirty days, the medical doctors were\\ndumbfounded and astonished by what happened to this man\\'s body.\\nIn just thirty days of eating McDonald\\'s food this man gained twenty-\\nfive pounds. In just thirty days! But it\\'s worse than that. He started at\\nonly 185 pounds, so he gained almost 20 percent of his original body\\nweight. No doctor could believe it.\\nI can believe it because I know that McDonald\\'s, like every other\\nfast-food restaurant, in my opinion, is purposely putting ingredients in\\nthe food to get you physically addicted to the food, increase your appe-\\ntite, and make you fat. This movie certainly makes one believe that it is\\nabsolutely true. From a health standpoint, the doctors were again aston-\\nished. His liver virtually turned to fat. His cholesterol shot up sixty-five\\npoints. His body-fat percentage went from 11 to over 18 percent. He\\nnearly doubled his risk of coronary heart disease. He felt depressed and\\nexhausted most of the time. His moods swung on a dime, and his sex\\nlife became virtually nonexistent. He craved this McDonald\\'s food more\\nand more when he ate it, and he got massive headaches when he didn\\'t!\\nThe doctor said if kept on this diet, he would definitely develop coro-\\nnary artery disease, inflammation and hardening of the liver, probably\\ndevelop dozens of various illnesses and diseases, and would certainly\\ndie an early death.\\nThe doctors who did the blood work could not believe how this man\\nwas, in effect, dying in just thirty days!

That\\'s the reason why this man became\\nso sick in such a short period of time. This is why you need to know\\nthat if you are sick and are eating food from fast-food restaurants, or\\nfrom publicly traded corporations, they are in fact making you sick. It\\nis the poisons, chemicals, additives, and energetic altering of the food\\nthat\\'s making you ill.\\nLet me point out a few other things from this documentary in\\nrelation to fast food. Fast-food restaurants, like all food manufac-\\nturers, have only one legal objective and that is to increase profits.\\nThey increase profits by getting more of your money. They increase\\nprofits by selling you more and more food. One of the ways they do\\nthis is increasing the portion size. Keeping in mind that in order for\\nany of these techniques to work they have to make the food so that it\\nbecomes chemically addicting to you; therefore, you crave it and need\\nto eat it. They have to make the food actually increase your appetite\\nso you eat more, and they have to make the food cause you to become\\nobese, that way you will continue to buy more and more food.\\nWhen french fries were first sold at McDonald\\'s there was one size.\\nThat size french fries is now the \"small.\" McDonald\\'s also has a medi-\\num, a large, and a super-size. The original size is still there, but no\\none ever orders it. The difference is the original size was 200 calories,\\nbut the super-size is over 600 calories. When Burger King first opened\\nthey sold a twelve-ounce small soda and a sixteen-ounce large soda.\\nToday, the twelve-ounce soda is called \"kiddy\"; the sixteen-ounce is\\nno longer a large, it is now the \"small.\" They have a medium, which\\nis thirty-two ounces, and a forty-two ounce size. This is pretty much\\nacross the board at all fast-food restaurants. In the movie Supersize\\nMe it was mentioned that cars have introduced larger cup holders to\\naccommodate those huge 7-Eleven double gulps, which are sixty-four\\nounces, a full half gallon, and hold anywhere from 600 to 800 calories.\\nJust imagine, a half gallon of soda for one person. That is forty-eight\\nteaspoons of sugar.\\nFast-food restaurants also are involved in some of the most devious\\nadvertising campaigns ever put on the public. This is similar to what\\nhappened in the tobacco industry. As discussed in the documentary\\nSupersize Me, a secret study by one of the tobacco companies was\\nabout brand imprinting for later acquisition in life!

Kids who eat in fast-food restaurants as little as three times a\\nweek have elevated abnormal liver function tests. Under a microscope\\nthe livers have evidence of scaring of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, and\\nearly states of sclerosis. This is all caused by fast food.\\nI also encourage you strongly to read the book Fast Food Nation so\\nyou can see just how bad fast food really is, not only for your health, but\\nfor society in general. Think about this: The average American child sees\\n10,000 food advertisements per year on TV alone. Ninety-five percent of\\nthose are for sugared cereals, soft drinks, fast food, and candy. It\\'s not a\\nfair fight. The food industry has the money and the clout to brainwash\\nour children into buying their products, giving us disease and illness. The\\nscary thing is when children are shown pictures of such people as George\\nWashington, Abraham Lincoln, George Bush, and Jesus Christ, they gen-\\nerally have no idea who these people are. But when they are shown a\\npicture of Ronald McDonald, every single one knows his name. And the\\nsad part is they believe that he is a \"good man\" who is helping children.\\nThis is how the food industry misleads and brainwashes our kids.\\nThink about this, as discussed in the movie Supersize Me: com-\\npanies spend billions of dollars making sure you know about their\\nproduct. In 2001 on direct media advertising alone, that\\'s radio, televi-\\nsion, and print, McDonald\\'s spent $1.4 billion worldwide getting you to\\nbuy their products.

Think about the way food is marketed: tee-\\nshirts, coupons, toys for children, giveaways in fast-food places, and\\nplacemats, and all the different ways to get you to buy food. The most\\nheavily advertised foods are the most consumed. There is no surprise.\\nWhoever spends the most money on advertising sells the most food.\\nThink about this scary fact, the majority of people tested could not\\nrecite the Pledge of Allegiance; however, almost all of them could sing\\nthe Big Mac song...two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese...\\nYou are probably singing it right now!\\nThe scariest thing to me is how fast food is in effect being sold in\\nschools. When you look at the school lunch programs, it is absolutely\\nappalling. Again, watch the movie Supersize Me to get the full story.\\nThe most appalling observation is there is huge resistance from junk-\\nfood companies that make huge profits off of the schools. Junk-food\\ncompanies do not want to get kicked out of the school system. They\\nwant to be there to addict the children and have them as customers\\nfor life.\\nThis points out many things. Major food manufacturers know their\\nfoods are dangerous, and deadly, and cause harm to the body. They\\ndon\\'t care. They are specifically targeting children because as large\\npublicly traded corporations they have only one objective, which is to\\nmake and increase profit. Therefore, they will do anything, and hurt\\nanyone, and destroy people\\'s lives, and virtually give people disease\\nand illness, all in the name of increasing profits. These food companies\\nare demanding that soda machines and junk food be sold in schools,\\nand will do everything they can to increase the usage of their prod-\\nucts by these kids; therefore, giving these kids guaranteed illness and\\ndisease. The motivation for profit is unbelievable, overwhelming, and\\nconsuming to these corporations.\\nBack to McDonald\\'s, consider thisâas I mentioned, McDonald\\'s,\\nin my opinion, is manufacturing food that is in effect like a drug. All\\nfast-food companies and junk-food manufacturers ideally want you to\\nbe physically addicted to their food, just like a drug dealer wants you\\nto become physically addicted to his drug. They also want you to have\\nan increased appetite for their food. This is why, in my opinion, these\\ncompanies have spent millions of dollars in secret laboratories produc-\\ning chemical additives that purposely are put into the food that get you\\nphysically chemically addicted to the food, increase your appetite, and\\nmake you fat.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Twenty-two percent of the people who eat at McDonald\\'s are super\\nheavy users.

The Associated Press reports that toxic dust\\nis a household threat! The article states that Americans are exposed\\nto a variety of potentially dangerous chemicals in their homes from\\nproducts such as computers, frying pans, shower curtains, cleaning\\nchemicals, bug sprays, etc. A study found thirty-five hazardous indus-\\ntrial chemicals in household dust samples. This brings home the fact\\nthat hazardous chemicals are in our daily lives. All of these chemicals\\nare known to be harmful to the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular,\\nand reproductive systems. Infants and children are especially vulner-\\nable! The lobbying group, the American Chemistry Council, which\\nrepresents major chemical companies, made the insane statement\\n\"Just because a toxic substance is found in dust or in the body doesn\\'t\\nnecessarily mean it causes health problems.\" This is why you need\\nair filters and air cleaners and you must start using nontoxic, organic\\ncleaners and other substances in your home. This also points out one\\nof the leading causes of illnesses in infants and children.\\nQuestion: Is it true you have given millions of dollars away?\\nAnswer: I believe what a person does in terms of his personal giving is\\na private matter. When you see companies and individuals publicizing\\ntheir charitable giving, please note that this is being done specifically\\nto make you believe how wonderful they are. Corporations not only\\ngive money to charity, but usually spend more money publicizing the\\nfact that they are giving money to charity! They do this to brainwash\\npeople into believing that they are really \"good for the communities.\"\\nI have never publicized my personal giving.

This is when it causes obesity\\nand causes disease. When making a profit is involved above everything\\nelse, you can be assured that the food being produced is deadly. Think\\nabout the average farmer. He wants to produce some vegetables and\\nmake a profit. The problem is chemical companies bombard him with\\nsales pitches telling \"Farmer Joe\" how he can increase his yield and\\nincrease his profits by using their fantastic chemicals. So Farmer Joe\\nfirst buys hybrid, genetically modified seed that he is told will produce\\nmore crops faster and be germ resistant. The problem, of course, is\\nthis is an unnatural food that when consumed by a human being actu-\\nally causes disease. Farmer Joe then has to use chemical fertilizers to\\nmake the vegetables grow at an unnaturally, unhealthy fast rate. He\\nthen sprays incredibly poisonous and deadly bug killers, pesticides, and\\nherbicides on his vegetables. These are all absorbed into the vegetables\\nand cannot be washed off. In order to make the vegetables look beautiful\\nand last longer, they are picked before they are ripe and put into a gas\\nchamber and sprayed with more chemicals. They are then shipped to\\nthe grocery store where they can last for days or weeks without spoil-\\ning or going bad. You then eat them. The problem is the whole process\\nguarantees that the product is genetically modified, full of toxins and\\nchemicals, devoid of any nutrients and, because of the irradiation,\\nenergetically changed, causing the food to be toxic to the body.\\nQuestion: Can something as serious as multiple sclerosis be cured\\nwith natural methods?\\nAnswer: Absolutely yes.

I\\nalso let her know that I was not a doctor or a licensed health-care practi-\\ntioner and could not treat her, and that she must seek professional help,\\nbut I was only giving her my opinions and was not trying to \"practice\\nmedicine.\" Three months later she called and explained that she could\\nnot believe the spectacular results that she had experienced; she felt\\nlike a new woman and felt fifteen years younger. This is a good example\\nof how simple \"natural cures\" work.\\nQuestion: Will \"natural cures\" work for everybody?\\nAnswer: I believe \"natural cures\" will work for everyone, but the\\nspecific \"natural cure\" that works for one person\\'s symptoms may\\nnot work for another. An example is not everyone who smokes ciga-\\nrettes conies down with lung cancer, but 98 percent of the people that\\ndevelop lung cancer smoke cigarettes. What this means is not every\\nsingle person that drinks diet soda will come down with multiple scle-\\nrosis, but almost everyone who comes down with multiple sclerosis\\nprobably is adversely affected by the aspartame in the diet soda. This\\nis an important aspect to understand. Not everyone who puts a laptop\\ncomputer on their lap will develop prostate cancer or arthritis in the\\nknees, but almost all the people that have these types of problems\\nwere probably adversely affected by the laptop computer that they\\nhad on their lap.

If a person walked up to you and\\nsaid, \"Every time I hit my foot with a hammer it hurts. How do I stop\\nthe pain?\" You would laugh and simply say \"Stop hitting your foot with a\\nhammer.\" If a person said \"Every time I pour kerosene all over my house\\nand light it with a match, my house catches fire. How do I stop my house\\nfrom burning?\" You would say \"Stop dousing your house with kerosene\\nand putting a match to it.\" Do you get what I\\'m trying to say? If you go\\nto a licensed health-care practitioner and say, \"I have acid reflux. What\\nto I do?\" what you are really saying is, \"Every time I load my body with\\nall these chemicals that the food industry is putting in our food supply, I\\nget a burning sensation in my stomach.\" Well, simply the answer is, stop\\nloading up your body with chemicals. Does this make sense?\\nA man came to me and said, \"I have osteoporosis, what do I do?\" The\\nanswer was, \"Let\\'s come up with the cause of your osteoporosis. What\\nis causing your body not to absorb enough calcium. Either (a) you are\\nnot getting enough calcium in your diet, or (b) there is something that\\nis blocking the absorption of calcium. It\\'s really pretty simple isn\\'t it?\"\\nHe said \"Yes.\" I said, \"Well, do you know the things that block calcium\\nabsorption?\" He didn\\'t know. I said, \"Carbonated sodas. Do you drink a\\nlot of them?\" His jaw almost hit the ground. He said, \"I drink about ten a\\nday.\" \"Well, if you are drinking ten a day, you are blocking your calcium\\nabsorption. It doesn\\'t mean that is the reason for your osteoporosis, but\\nit certainly could be.\" I told my friend to go see a licensed health-care\\npractitioner and suggested that he consider stopping the carbonated\\nsodas and maybe he would start absorbing calcium better. Interestingly\\nenough, within a few months his problem was solved. He was \"cured.\"\\nSomebody will ask, \"But not everyone who drinks carbonated sodas\\nhas osteoporosis.\" That\\'s true, and not everyone who smokes cigarettes\\ndies of lung cancer, but virtually everyone who dies of lung cancer has\\nsmoked cigarettes.

Example: If a man comes to you and says, \"Every time\\nI hit my foot with a hammer it hurts,\" even if he stops hitting his foot\\nwith a hammer he may still have pain. Why? Because he hit his foot\\nwith a hammer so long he actually broke bones in his foot; therefore,\\nthere is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed.

He has an emergency and he has to\\ndo something to stop the burning now.\\nYour medical condition may be exactly the same. If you find the cause\\nof your problem while consulting with a licensed health-care practitio-\\nner, you still have an immediate situation that needs to be addressed.\\nThat\\'s what this chapter is really all about. Chapter 6 addresses virtu-\\nally the cause of all disease. I\\'ll say it over and over again, because if\\nI ever meet you personally I will test you. Remember the four causes\\nof all disease? (1) Toxins in the body; (2) nutritional deficiencies; (3)\\nelectromagnetic chaos; and (4) emotional and mental stress. If you do\\nall the things in Chapter 6 you will address all four of those issues and\\nvirtually cure yourself of every disease, and prevent virtually every\\ndisease. However, there is an excellent chance you have done nothing\\npositive for your health in twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years. So there\\nis a good chance that you have a real serious situation that needs some\\nparticular attention.\\nThis is why I will state over, and over, and over againâgo to a licensed\\nhealth-care practitioner who doesn\\'t use drugs and surgery, and ideally\\ngo to two or three different people to get different opinions. Getting per-\\nsonalized treatment is invaluable and there is no substitute.\\nNow, when you go to your licensed health-care practitioner and\\ncome up with a personalized treatment for your particular situation,\\nyou can consider some of the following things. Remember, I am not a\\ndoctor; I have no medical training; I am not a health-care practitioner;\\nI am not prescribing medical treatment; I am not treating any medical\\ncondition; I do not treat patients; and I am not making any attempt\\nin this book to prescribe, diagnose, or treat any illness, or treat any\\npatient.

This is the\\nprocedure that I would follow if I were to come down with some illness\\nor disease. Keep in mind, because I do the things in Chapter 6, I have\\nvirtually never been sick.\\n1. Go back to Chapter 6 and do all the things in Chapter 6.\\nI cannot emphasize this enough. The things that I mention in Chapter\\n6, such as seeing a licensed health-care practitioner, getting energetic\\nrebalancing, doing all of the cleanses, etc. will, in my opinion, and in\\nmost cases, cure almost all disease. Doing the things in Chapter 6 can\\neliminate virtually all symptoms in a very short period of time because\\nit addresses the root cause of all illness. Simply doing energetic rebal-\\nancing, or doing the cleanses listed, can cure the \"incurable.\" This is\\ndocumented and proven. Over a million reports from all around the\\nworld have shown that this is categorically, 100 percent true. Simply\\ndoing the things in Chapter 6 can cure disease.\\nIn addition to doing the things in Chapter 6, there are some specific\\nthings that you could do that could help your body return to a state of\\n\"homeostasis\" (balance) which will allow your body to heal itself faster.\\nRemember, there is no drug, no surgical procedure, and no natural\\nremedy that actually cures disease. The \"natural cure\" for all disease\\nis doing the things that bring your body back to balance so the body\\ncan heal itself. Only the body can heal itself. So in addition to doing the\\nthings in Chapter 6, I now present to you an A to Z list of some com-\\nmon diseases, and some specific additional therapies that can be done\\nin conjunction with the things mentioned in Chapter 6.\\nEvery single one of these illnesses and diseases can be cured, in my\\nopinion, by simply doing the things in Chapter 6. Example: For every\\none of these diseases I should say \"First, go to a licensed health-care\\npractitioner.\" Getting individualized treatment from a licensed health-\\ncare practitioner, which could include essential oils, herbs, homeo-\\npathic remedies, chiropractic care, vitamins, minerals, etc., can cure\\nall disease. Getting energetic rebalancing and doing nothing else can\\nvirtually cure every disease.

Therefore, again, I cannot emphasis enough to go back to\\nChapter 6 and do the things in Chapter 6. If you want to cure yourself\\nof the disease you have, you absolutely must get the toxins that are in\\nyour body out, and stop putting them in; you must start giving your\\nbody super nutrition because you are nutrient deficient; you must\\nstop or at least neutralize the electromagnetic chaos that you are\\nbeing exposed to; and you must eliminate the trapped emotional and\\nmental stress that you are holding in your body unconsciously. Doing\\nthese things will bring your body pH from acidic to alkaline where\\ndisease cannot exist.

Did you know that virtually every disease has been shown to be\\ncured by simply doing a colon cleanse? Did you know that virtually\\nevery disease has been reported to be cured by simply doing a liver\\ncleanse?

A disease\\nis simply a label put on a series of symptoms. The symptoms could be\\ncaused by hundreds of different factors, or combinations of factors.\\nThis is one of the things that medical science does not want you to\\nunderstand or know about. In order for the medical community to\\nmake money they must \"isolate\" a specific something so that they\\ncan find a drug that can be patented to treat it. This is how they make\\nbillions of dollars in profits.\\nThe fact is each individual person must be treated individually by\\na licensed health-care practitioner and given personalized individual-\\nized treatments and protocols.

Example: If you have\\ngenital herpes, we all know the cause is a virus. What we don\\'t know\\nis why the virus became active in you. Everyone gets exposed to the\\nvirus, but not everyone develops breakouts and succumbs to the virus.\\nSo even though we do know that it is a virus, if you had five people\\nwho had genital herpes breakouts, each person\\'s reason that they suc-\\ncumbed to the herpes virus could be different; therefore, the treat-\\nment that would work for each of the five persons could be slightly\\ndifferent. In one person red marine algae may completely kill the virus\\nand you will never have an outbreak ever again. In another person it\\ncould be the herb larrea; in another person hydrogen peroxide applied\\nto the breakout could kill the virus; in another person DMSO applied\\nto the breakout area could kill the virus; in another person lysine\\ncould suppress that symptom.

These cures are inexpensive\\nand have virtually no negative side effects. I am not a doctor. I do not\\ntreat patients. According to the U.S. Government, I cannot diagnose\\nor treat disease. If I were to cure someone of cancer, I could go to jail\\nfor practicing medicine without a license. Therefore, I am presenting\\nthis information for educational purposes only.\\nI know that therapies such as energetic medicine, homeopathy,\\nherbs, nutritional supplements and cleansing can help the body heal\\nitself. What standard medicine attempts to do is to look at a person\\'s\\nsymptoms, call it a \"disease,\" and then prescribe drugs or surgery to\\nsuppress or eliminate the symptom. Unfortunately, medical doctors\\ndo not look for the cause; they only attempt to suppress the symp-\\ntoms. If you simply suppress a symptom, you have not addressed the\\ncause and the person will continue to get sick. Combine that with\\nthe new illnesses that are actually caused by the drugs themselves,\\nand we find that a patient treated by a medical doctor with drugs\\nand surgery continues to become sicker and sicker over time. A good\\nexample is a child who appears to have hyperactivity and a low atten-\\ntion span. He will probably be diagnosed with attention deficit disor-\\nder. Doctors will say that the child\\'s brain chemistry is not right, and\\nhe needs a drug to fix the imbalance in the brain chemistry. The drug\\nmay have some short-term effects on balancing the brain chemistry,\\nbut the question that was missed is WHY the brain chemistry was\\nunbalanced to begin with. What caused the chemical imbalance? If\\nthis was asked, we almost always find that food allergies, excitotoxins\\nsuch as MSG and aspartame, and food additives are to blame. With\\nsimple dietary adjustments the brain chemistry becomes balanced,\\nand the child, in a matter of days, is no longer hyperactive and his\\nattention span is back to normal.\\nAnother example is when a person has pain, a doctor will give a\\ndrug to suppress the pain. All the drug does is stop the pain signals from\\nreaching the brain. The cause of the pain is never addressed; if it is,\\nwe virtually always find the pain was caused by a blockage in electro-\\nmagnetic impulses between cells. The Chinese actually discovered over\\n2,000 years ago that with simple nondrug and nonsurgical procedures,\\nthe cause could be addressed and the pain eliminated permanently.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

COM 365\\nImagine you are driving your car and the oil light goes on. That\\nwould be a symptom of a bigger problem. To \"correct\" the situation, you\\ncould simply take the bulb out. You stopped the symptom; the oil light\\nis no longer illuminated. But you have not addressed the cause, continu-\\ning to run your car without oil, which will quickly cause major engine\\ndamage. The human body is the same way. Think about it this way: You\\ndon\\'t have a headache because you have an aspirin deficiency.\\nThe most important thing you can do is prevent disease and\\nsickness. Most people wait until they have symptoms before seeking\\nmedical attention. In many cases the problem is so severe that major\\nattention is needed. Imagine a person who never takes his car in for\\nmaintenance. One day the car starts making funny noises. The per-\\nson does not immediately take the car in for service. He continues\\nto drive the car, not realizing that the problem is getting worse and\\nworse. The car finally stops running and must be towed in to the\\nservice station. The mechanic says all the bearings are worn out and\\nmust be replaced, a major engine overhaul. Our body is very similar.\\nPeople run their bodies with aches and pains and symptoms, using\\ndrugs to suppress the symptoms without addressing the cause. One\\nday the problem is so severe they seek medical attention and are told\\n\"Your body is riddled with cancer,\" or \"Your arteries are almost com-\\npletely clogged and they need immediate bypass surgery.\" This would\\nnever happen if a person did basic maintenance of their body.\\nThe pH test, in my opinion, is one of the simplest and best ways to\\ndetermine your health potential. If your saliva and urine pH is alkaline,\\ndisease and sickness virtually cannot exist. Remember, most serious\\nmedical conditions such as cancer, heart disease, arthritis and any pain\\nin general did not develop overnight. The condition was developing for\\nyears before you ever noticed a symptom. I was asked one time what I\\nwould do if I found out I had cancer or heart disease. My response was\\nthat that was virtually impossible since I routinely check my body pH\\nand monitor my arteries. Blocked arteries, for example, develop over\\nyears. I would know if my arteries were beginning to clog years before\\nany major blockages. If I discovered this, I would utilize natural treat-\\nments such as nutritional therapy, and chelation. I would then review\\nmy condition to see if it stayed the same, got worse or got better. The key\\nelement is that I would know years in advance of any major problem.\\nThe good news is that even if you do have a major problem, there\\nare natural alternatives to drugs and surgery in most cases.

She wondered if she\\nshould take the doctor's advice and give the child Ritalin. I suggested\\nthat she see some health-care practitioners who use all-natural treat-\\nments instead of drugs and surgery. I asked what the child ate, trying\\nto get her to be as specific as possible. I said simply eliminate all dairy\\nproducts, white sugar, white flour, aspartame, and MSG. I wrote down\\nrecommended meals and educated her on how to read food labels.

I gave her my number and asked her to call me, as I was curious\\nto know the results. Three days later she called. This woman was out of\\nher mind. She told me that she absolutely could not believe the change\\nin her child. The hyperactivity was virtually gone and the child's atten-\\ntion span and ability to concentrate was near 100 percent. For the first\\ntime in two years the child sat at the dinner table and ate his meal like a\\nnormal, well-mannered person. She even received a phone call from the\\nchild's teacher, who could not believe the change that had happened.\\nThese kinds of stories happen all the time.

This particular regulation is one of the major reasons\\nwhy illness and disease are increasing at the most alarming rate in\\nhistory. This regulation simply protects the profits of the pharma-\\nceutical industry. This must be changed. The FDA law should state\\n\"ANYTHING CAN CURE, PREVENT, OR TREAT A DISEASE.\" This\\nis the most fundamental thing that must be changed.

Anyone who has bypass surgery is a victim of the\\nfood industry and lack of knowledge. Let me explain. Clogged arteries\\ndo not happen overnight. It takes years to develop clogged arteries to\\nthe point where you need bypass surgery or you have a heart attack.\\nNo one should ever develop clogged arteries to the point where surgery\\nis used or a heart attack develops.\\nYou have to understand, as I have said in my book, that it is always\\nall about the money. The medical industry wants you to be sick. That\\'s\\nhow they make their profits. If everyone were healthy, the drug compa-\\nnies and the entire health-care industry would be out of business. The\\nreason your arteries get clogged is simple. In your blood, you have cho-\\nlesterol. The cholesterol will only attach itself to the artery wall when\\nthe artery is scarred or damaged. One of the biggest scams perpetrated\\non the American public is making you fearful of high cholesterol. I will\\nexplain this later, but consider that the number-one selling drug in the\\nworld is Lipitor, a cholesterol-reducing drug. The amount of cholesterol\\nhas nothing to do with your chances of getting hearth disease, clogged\\narteries, or a heart attack. The cholesterol in your blood is harmless and\\nactually healthy for you. The only time that cholesterol will attach itself\\nto the artery wall is when the artery is damaged. The question then is\\nwhat causes the artery to be damaged. The three main culprits are:\\n1.Chlorine in the water. When you drink water, take a shower, or\\ngo swimming in chlorinated water you are severely damaging your\\narteries.\\n2.Hydrogenated oils and trans fats. These are manmade products.\\nMost margarines, for example, are 100 percent hydrogenated oil.\\nVirtually everything you buy in the supermarket has hydrogenated\\noil in it. These trans fats are deadly to your health. They severely\\nscar and damage your arteries. Even the FDA is finally admitting\\nthe dangers of trans fats.\\n3.Homogenized dairy products. The homogenization process, which\\nwas developed to increase profits for grocers, makes dairy products a\\ndeadly poison. The homogenization process makes the molecules in\\ndairy products so small that they severely scar the arteries. It is not\\nthe fat in dairy products, it is the homogenization that\\'s the problem.\\nPeople are always coming up to me and saying, \"Well, I drink low-fat\\nmilk or skim milk. Isn\\'t that better than whole milk?\" The answer\\nis no. It\\'s not better; it\\'s worse. It\\'s a manmade product. Remember,\\nscience is not better than nature. Whole milk is better than low-fat\\nand skim milk, provided that it is not homogenized.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Even if you have incredibly low amounts of cholesterol, the\\ncholesterol will attach itself to the artery wall, causing blockages and\\nall the problems associated with it as I mentioned above. The most\\nimportant point I want to make here is that you should never have\\nblocked arteries and never need bypass surgery. Why? Because it\\ntakes ten, to twenty, to thirty years to get your arteries clogged. It\\nhappens slowly over time. What is amazing to me is that the medical\\ncommunity refuses to mention to patients that there are simple pain-\\nless tests that can be done to anyone at any time, inexpensively, to\\ndetermine if your arteries are fully open or are beginning to be clogged.\\nI recommend that every person, every year or two, get this simple\\ninexpensive test done. There are several types of tests available and\\nnew tests are being developed all the time. These tests show the blood\\nflow throughout your entire body, in all your veins and your arteries. If\\nyou take this test every year or two you can see what the current state\\nof your arteries are, whether they are open of clogged, and you can\\nsee the trend. You will see specifically if over time your arteries are\\nslowly beginning to get clogged. This way you will know fifteen years\\nin advance whether you are on the path of blocked arteries.\\nIf you are, you can take some simple steps to reverse the condition.\\nThe natural cure for this condition is chelation. There are two main\\ntypes of chelation: oral chelation and intravenous chelation.

You simply take these\\ntablets and they slowly begin to reopen your arteries and increase\\ncirculation. If your condition is very severe, intravenous chelation\\ncan be used as well. This way, you can virtually guarantee that you\\nwill never have clogged arteries, or any of the conditions that go along\\nwith it, and you will never need bypass surgery.

Every single one of you should call your\\nhealth-care practitioner and tell them you want to be tested to see\\nhow open your arteries are.

The body is\\ndesigned to walk. Formalized exercise is not done throughout the world.\\nThe majority of people who live to be over 100 years old and have virtu-\\nally no disease do not do formal exercise. However, they do walk. People\\nthroughout the world walk an average of ten miles a day where people\\nfrom America walk less than a quarter of a mile a day. If you want to\\nlose weight, walk. The ideal way to walk to lose weight is by walking for\\none hour non-stop every day. This is not running, it\\'s not jogging, it\\'s\\nwalking. You should be walking at a pace that you feel comfortable with.\\nSome of you will start out very, very slow. Some of you will not even be\\nable to walk for a full hour without getting too tired and winded. Start\\nwith fifteen minutes and increase to twenty-five minutes, increase that\\nto forty-five minutes, increase it to an hour. It may take you a month\\nbefore you get to a full hour. It\\'s sad because people all over the world\\ncan walk for hours and hours and hours. People in America can\\'t walk\\nfor an hour without getting tired or waking up the next day with sore\\nankles, knees, hips and legs. That means you are in desperate need of\\nwalking. If you walk for a full hour and then wake up with any stiffness,\\npain, or discomfort, you are in serious trouble. You are destined for ill-\\nness and disease. You are not moving the toxins out of your body, you\\nare not oxygenating your body, your muscles, tendons, joints, and liga-\\nments are all beginning to deteriorate and you are headed for a health\\ndisaster. You absolutely have to be walking: Walking will reverse your\\ncondition and cure you of many ailments.\\nThe main thing that walking does for weight loss is that it seems to\\nreset your body\\'s \"set point.\" Your body has a point that it sets regu-\\nlating your weight. If you go above this weight, it will regulate it back\\nto the set-point weight; if you go below this weight it will regulate it\\nback up to the set-point weight. Your body\\'s set point will determine\\nwhat your \"weight\" is. This is the reason why most people have a\\ncertain weight that they stay at. Even if they lose weight, they always\\nbounce back to that weight, or if they gain weight for a while because\\nof an eating binge, when they start eating normally they kind of revert\\nback to that set-point weight.

If you do this\\nevery single day, you will start losing weight automatically and effort-\\nlessly. Plus, you will feel better, have more energy, sleep better, be less\\ndepressed and be happier. When you walk it is important not to walk\\non a treadmill, but walk outside. It is important not to stare at the\\nground while walking, but look around you. The process of looking far\\naway at things has a profound effect on your mental state. You won\\'t\\nbelieve how much better you will feel and you won\\'t believe how easy\\nit is to lose weight without changing anything else.\\nFrom the BookâRest, the Key to Rejuvenation\\nIn my book, I talk about the importance of getting proper sleep and\\nproper rest. It is absolutely vital to get the proper amount of sleep\\nand have your body fully rested if you want to have optimal health,\\noptimal energy levels, lose weight, and guarantee you can cure any\\ndisease and never get sick again. Your body needs time to rejuvenate\\nand recharge. The optimal time to sleep is going to bed between\\n9:00 and 10:00 p.m. and arising at approximately 6:00 a.m. There are\\nseveral reasons for this. The cycles of the earth\\'s rotation around the\\nsun and the moon around the earth cause the body to rest better dur-\\ning these hours than at any other time. This is why people who work\\nnight shifts have been shown to be more depressed, more overweight,\\nmore tired, more fatigued, and have more illness and disease than\\nother people. It is also known that people who do not sleep a full eight\\nhours every night are not as happy and also get sick more often. The\\nbody secretes healing hormones during the times between 10:00 p.m.\\nand 2:00 a.m. If you are a person who goes to sleep very, very late,\\nyou are not giving your body the proper amount of hours it needs to\\nsecrete the hormones that will rejuvenate, recharge and refresh your\\nbody. The three basic important factors of rest and sleep are:\\n1. When you go to bed, and the times in which you are actually rest-\\ning. If you go to bed late and sleep late, even though you are getting\\na full eight hours, you are not doing your body good because those\\nhealing hormones can only be released between 10:00 p.m. and\\n2:00 a.m. It is absolutely vital that you are sleeping during those\\ntimes as most often as possible. So, the time in which you are get-\\nting rest is important.\\nDuring the evening hours the majority of people are sleeping\\nor resting.

This allows the body to recharge and reju-\\nvenate much better. Many people who are used to staying up very\\nlate, or sleeping until 8:00, 9:00, or 10:00 in the morning, have\\ninteresting observations when they start going to bed between 9:00\\nand 10:00 p.m. and arising at 6:00 a.m. Some people notice, even\\nfrom the very first night, that they have 100 times more energy,\\nthey feel better, they laugh more, their appetites are radically dif-\\nferent, they eat less, and they are happier. Other people are so\\nfatigued and tired for the first two or three days after starting this\\nnew sleep pattern they can\\'t believe how tired they are. The rea-\\nson for this phenomena is that the body finally has a chance to\\nrecharge and rejuvenate, and is taking this opportunity to reset the\\nbody. It may take three to four days for the body to adjust, it may\\ntake even a week, but once the body readjusts and realigns you\\nwon\\'t believe how much more energy you have, you will be able\\nto jump out of bed without an alarm clock, and you\\'ll have more\\nenergy throughout the day. You will have less sickness and disease\\nand, if you are currently sick or have any type of disease or symp-\\ntoms, many people will notice that they start going away and the\\nbody is healing itself and curing itself from the illness and disease\\nthat you have because you are giving the body a chance to do the\\nhealing work it needs during the only times that it can really do the\\nhealing, which is between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.\\n2.

You spend a third of your\\nlife sleeping, but people won\\'t invest any money and won\\'t invest\\nin any time in obtaining the appropriate and best sleeping system.\\nThis to me is just not a smart choice. There was an old commercial\\nfor Fram oil filters, and the commercial said, \"You can pay me now,\\nor you can pay me later.\" Your body is the same way. You can pay\\nnow by investing in things for your health, like a good mattress and\\nsleeping system, good quality air and water filters, good food, good\\nnutritional supplements, and educating yourself with knowledge,\\nor you can pay later with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis,\\nmajor surgeries, sickness, illness, disease, depression, stress, pain,\\nand misery.

The answer is it's a\\npersonal choice. There are three outstanding mattresses that I do\\nrecommend. For years I have slept on a 100-percent natural, all-\\norganic mattress made with all organic materials. This was very\\ngood because the materials did not emit any poisonous fumes that I\\nwould be inhaling for the entire night. Then, I invested in a $20,000\\nmattress. It is made with the finest cashmeres, the finest quality\\nsilks, and it is the mattress that the Queen of England sleeps on. It\\nis an incredibly comfortable bed with mostly natural organic mate-\\nrials, but it is outrageously expensive. I then decided to test some\\nother mattresses that most people could afford so I could make a\\nrecommendation. I tested the three most heavily advertised mat-\\ntresses on TV. All of these mattresses are outstanding and, in my\\nopinion, will give you a better, more restful night's sleep than other\\nkinds of mattresses. However, everyone is different and every body\\nis different; therefore, you should test these mattresses out your-\\nself. The good news is these companies will send you the mattress\\nfor a free-trial period. One, for example, has a three- to six-month\\nfree trial. I highly recommend that you call these companies, get\\nthe mattress sent to you for the free trial and try each one. After\\nthe free trial is over, send it back and then try the next one. You\\nwill virtually be sleeping on the finest mattresses made for free for\\nsix months to a year before you can make your purchasing deci-\\nsion. You then will have tested the various mattresses to see which\\none you like the best.\\nThe sheets that you use are vitally important to a proper\\nnight's rest. The material should be 100-percent organic and all-\\nnatural cotton. Other materials will emit a negative energy and a\\nnegative fume, which, although subtle, does have a slightly nega-\\ntive affect on your sleep. The sheets must be washed in organic\\nall-natural soap. Do not buy laundry detergent from a large pub-\\nlicly traded company. They are filled with chemicals and syn-\\nthetic fragrances that you will be inhaling all night causing you\\nsleep problems. This little thing can make a huge difference. I have\\nmet people who tell me they have a hard time sleeping. I walk into\\ntheir house, go into their bedroom, and just smell the sheets. It is\\nso obvious to me, based on the fragrance that I can smell, why they\\nare not sleeping well.

No wonder you\\nweren\\'t sleeping well.\"\\nThe air that is in your bedroom is vitally important to a good\\nnight\\'s sleep. Today\\'s homes are not built like they were seventy-five\\nyears ago. Before air conditioning, homes were built with natural\\nmaterials, not synthetic manmade materials. Homes were designed\\nfor the windows to be opened so that air could flow easily through-\\nout the house. Today\\'s homes are different. We generally sleep with\\nall the windows closed and air conditioning or heating systems in\\noperation. The air quality in our homes is absolutely horrible and\\nworse than ever before. Combine that with the fumes that are\\nemanating from the synthetic materials used in the carpeting, the\\nwalls, and all the glues used in today\\'s homes we can see that our\\nair quality is terrible. This adversely affects our sleep and adversely\\naffects the healing process. It suppresses our immune system and\\nmakes us more susceptible to illness and disease, and can cause\\neverything from allergies to depression to cancer. Combine that\\nwith the fact that our houses are wired with so much electricity\\nthat we are being bombarded the entire evening with energetic\\nfrequencies that are disturbing our sleep, making ourselves go\\ncrazy, suppressing our immune system, and making us much more\\nsusceptible to illness and disease. Our sleeping environments today\\nare not conducive to allowing the body to recharge, and rejuvenate,\\nand regenerate, and heal. Our sleeping environments today do the\\nexact opposite.\\nWhile they are sleeping, most people never get into a deep\\nsleep where healing can occur. Most people don\\'t sleep during the\\ntimes when the healing hormones are released. Most people do\\nnot get the proper amount of sleep, so the body doesn\\'t have time\\nto recharge. Most people are in an environment where their bed\\nitself is causing them pain, discomfort, and pressure hindering\\ncirculation, hindering healing. The air quality is hindering deep\\nsleep, causing allergies, filling us with more toxins and poisons,\\nsuppressing our immune system, and the energetic fields around\\nus are making our cells vibrate totally out of balance, leading us to\\nall types of illness, disease, and even cancer.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Have you ever noticed, if you\\nwent on a camping trip and slept in the woods, where there is no wir-\\ning around your tent or cabin, how incredibly deep you sleep, how\\nmuch rest you get, and how much calmer you feel? This is important\\nfor health.\\nThe second thing that is vital in your sleeping environment is\\nsome type of an air-purification system. There are several. In my\\nhome, my air conditioning and heating unit has electrostatic and\\nhepa filters built in. They are very expensive and need constant\\nmaintenance. Additionally, an ozone generator is very helpful.\\nBasic air purifiers or hepa filters are excellent, but can be very\\nloud. There are several brands on the market that make good air\\nfilters, but the problem is the noise is not conducive for good sleep.\\nAlso, photo catalysis units are silent and do a great job of cleaning\\nthe air. In my bedroom, in addition to the hepa filters and elec-\\ntrostatic filters in my entire heating and air-conditioning system,\\nI have two ionic type air filters, plus a photo catalysis unit that I\\nhave on during sleep. I also use an air purifier with ozone that I\\nturn on when I'm not sleeping to cleanse and purify the air, and\\nthe ozone also permeates the fabrics to make sure I'm not inhaling\\nany poisonous or disruptive fumes while I am sleeping. People tell\\nme that when they start using air purification systems that they\\nbreathe better, they sleep better, they have more energy when they\\nwake up, congestion is diminished, and allergies are reduced.\\nA proper mattress, proper sheets, proper soap used to clean\\nthe sheets, an electronic chaos eliminator, and air filtration will not\\ncure any disease, but what they do is provide a better environment\\nfor you to get deep sleep so that your body can recharge, ejuvenate,\\nand heal itself.

I categorically, 100 percent recom-\\nmend that no one should be using toothpaste with fluoride in it. As\\nalways, I recommend that you stay away from any product manufac-\\ntured by a large publicly traded corporation. Publicly traded corpora-\\ntions have only one goal, and that is to make money. They will cut\\ncorners at every chance and spend the majority of their money on\\nmarketing and packaging, not on the quality of the product. They will\\ndo everything they can to produce that product at the lowest possible\\ncost, thus ensuring that the natural state and quality is adversely\\naffected. Therefore, it is imperative that you stay away from tooth-\\npastes sold by large publicly traded companies, and stay away from\\nany toothpaste that has fluoride in it.\\nFluoride is a dangerous, poisonous chemical. It is so deadly that\\neven the smallest amount, if consumed, can kill you. It causes all types\\nof physiological problems; the most notable is fluoride reduces the abil-\\nity of the thyroid gland to operate correctly creating a condition known\\nas a hypoactive thyroid, or an under active thyroid. When your thyroid\\nis not acting properly, your metabolism is very slow, causing you to\\ngain weight. Fluoride in toothpaste and fluoride in the water is one of\\nthe major reasons why we have such obesity levels in America today.\\nIn communities that have the highest amounts of fluoride in their water\\nsupply, there are also the highest amounts of obesity and a host of other\\ndiseases. The link is indisputable. You should brush your teeth at least\\ntwice a day the first thing in the morning and before you go to bed, and\\nideally, you should brush your teeth after every meal. Keep in mind,\\nhowever, that animals in the wild do not brush their teeth. Animals in\\nthe wild are eating raw, very hard crunchy material, thus cleaning their\\nteeth on a regular basis. Animals in the wild also do not consume the\\nmanmade processed food that cause tooth decay and gum disease.\\nIf you want a beautiful healthy smile, brush your teeth but use a\\ntoothpaste that is 100 percent all-natural and has ingredients that you\\ncan pronounce. I vary my toothpaste from time-to-time. When I fin-\\nish one tube I go to the health food store, see what is available, and I\\nread the ingredient list. If there are only two or three ingredients that\\nI can read and pronounce and the company is a small independently\\nowned business, I try that product. You should do the same.

There are many, many ways and\\nall of them are very, very good. All of them seem to do similar things,\\nyet different things. This book, The 7-Day Detox Miracle: How to\\nRevitalize Your Mind and Body with This Safe and Effective Life-\\nEnhancing Program has a very powerful, simple seven-day home\\ndetox program that you can do. This system can allow you to free\\nyourself from chronic aches and pains, allow you to feel healthier, and\\nbe more energetic. The process is really called detoxification, and it\\nstimulates your body\\'s natural ability to cleanse itself. Remember, the\\nmajor reason you are sick is because your body has too many toxins\\nin it. You must get the toxins out. People are always coming up to me\\nsaying, \"How do I cure herpes? How do I cure my diabetes? How do\\nI cure my arthritis? What\\'s the cure?\" The answer is, in most cases,\\nthere isn\\'t a \"cure.\" The reason you are sick is because (1) you have too\\nmany toxins in your body; (2) you are deficient in the nutrients your\\nbody needs for optimal health; and (3) the electronic chaos and energy\\nfrequencies that are bombarding us are making you sick. Those are the\\nthree major reasons that we are all ill. You will never get well, you will\\nnever cure your disease, you will never live at optimal levels unless\\nyou get the toxins out. You are all super toxic. Getting the toxins out\\nwill improve resistance to disease, normalize your weight, and increase\\nphysical and mental stamina. It\\'s similar to an oil change in your car.\\nYou need to clean out the sludge so your body can operate more effec-\\ntively. There are many ways to cleanse, from doing colonies, fasting, raw\\nfood, sweating, etc. There are many products you can buy that will help\\nyou cleanse such as herbs, benkonite clay, fiber like psyllium seeds or\\npsyllium husks, and wheatgrass juice. All are very good.

How do I cure it?\\nA: The medical community states that there is no cure for herpes. For\\nyears the medical community has repeatedly made statements of\\nfacts, when in reality it is nothing more than their opinions. Keep\\nin mind the amount of money made by making people believe that\\nyou cannot \"cure\" herpes. The amount of drugs sold in the treat-\\nment of herpes is astronomical. The profits made are astronomical.\\nIf you have genital herpes, or if you have cold sores on a regular or\\nrecurring basis, you have a herpetic virus in your system. That\\'s\\nwhat everyone seems to think is true. Most people think that once\\nyou have the herpetic virus, it will stay with you forever and there\\nis no way you can \"cure\" it. The answer is no one really knows\\nwhether the virus leaves or stays in your system. No one can really\\nsee the virus. Medical science can only see the antibodies your body\\ndevelops if you have allegedly been infected with the virus. Keep\\nin mind that this is all medical theory, and none of this is \"known\\nfacts.\" The only thing I\\'m concerned with is if you have breakouts,\\nyour ideal scenario is that you never have another breakout ever\\nagain. Well, if you never had a breakout ever again, I would call that\\na cure. I don\\'t know if the medical community would call it a cure,\\nbut I would. So the real question is not \"How do I \\'cure\\' my herpes?\"\\nThe real question is, \"I have breakouts,\" whether they are genital\\nor cold sore-type breakouts, \"what can I do so that I don\\'t have any\\nmore breakouts?\" That is the real question. Well, I\\'m not sure if this\\ntreatment that I\\'m about to give you will allow you to never have\\nanother breakout but, from everyone I\\'ve ever talked to, most people\\nnever have another breakout and for those who do it\\'s so rare and so\\nshort-lived that it doesn\\'t really matter.\\n1.You have to cleanse and detoxify your body. The reason you have\\nbreakouts is because your immune system is suppressed and\\nallows the virus to activate. If your immune system is low, the\\nvirus will activate. You have to do a cleanse, a colon cleanse, a\\nCandida cleanse, a liver and gallbladder cleanse. You must do these\\ncleanses because without the cleanses your body\\'s immune system\\nwill always be weak and you will always be susceptible to disease.\\n2.You need proper nutrients.

You need to supplement your diet with proper food\\nsupplements whole food supplements. You need to get nutrition.\\nIdeally, juicing or taking whole-food supplements.

If you go to the EMC2, which is talked about in the book\\nSanctuary, and sign up for the AIM program like I am on, you will\\nhave your energetic frequencies balanced twenty-four hours a day,\\nseven days a week. I highly recommend and endorse that. Go to:\\nwww.energeticmatrix.com/\\n4.Lysine. Lysine is an amino acid that will suppress the ability for\\nbreakouts to develop. If you eat food with lots of arginine, such as\\npeanuts and tomatoes, you have a tendency to increase breakouts.\\nSo the best way to prevent breakouts is to take lysine daily. Go to\\nyour health food store and inquire.\\n5.Red Marine Algae. This appears to kill and wipe out the herpes virus.\\nYou can go to a health food store there are several brands available.\\nThe ideal scene is when you begin to feel the next breakout com-\\ning on, take the red marine algae and take it nonstop for sixty days.\\nJust by doing that there is an excellent chance you will never have\\nanother breakout again. If you do, the moment you feel the break-\\nout, start taking the red marine algae. You will notice the breakouts\\nare much, much less severe and don\\'t last as long. Continue that\\nprocedure until you never have another breakout again.\\n6.There is a product in health food stores called DMSO. When applied\\nit kills the herpes virus. Also, drink liquid oxygen available in health\\nfood stores, as the virus cannot live in an oxygen rich environment.\\n7.Larrea. This plant is anti-viral and can kill the herpes virus in 30\\ndays.\\nIf you do the things I recommend, I believe that (1) your break-\\nouts will be less frequent and less severe, and (2) there is an excellent\\nchance you will never have another breakout again. As always, I am\\nnot a doctor. I am not giving medical advice. I am giving my opinions\\nfor educational and informational purposes only. It is vital if you are\\nconcerned about your health that you seek out proper health-care pro-\\nfessionals in your area and get their opinions and have somebody treat\\nyou directly.

If we know what the cause is and eliminate it, you can prevent\\ncancer and potentially reverse cancer if it has not gone past the point\\nof no return.

I believe one of the major causes of cancer,\\nas well as one of the major causes of multiple sclerosis, muscular dys-\\ntrophy, attention deficit disorder, fibromyalgia, arthritis, lupus, and\\nvirtually all diseases, is eating food that has been in a microwave oven.\\nYou are reading this right. Let\\'s consider that microwave ovens were\\ninvented by the Nazis. The Soviets took over the research that was\\nstarted in Berlin, and looked very intently at how eating microwaved\\nfood affected the body. They found so many physical ailments that\\nseemed to be caused directly from eating microwaved food that the\\nKremlin banned these machines for use.\\nAuthors Anthony Wayne and Lawrence Newell state in their article,\\n\"The Hidden Hazards of Microwave Cooking,\" that the Russian research-\\ners found microwaved food had a decreased nutritional value and a sig-\\nnificant diminishing of their \"vital energy fields\" of up to 90 percent!\\nFoods with little nutritional value and no \"vital energy\" have a major\\nnegative effect on the body. Food that is in a microwave, even for just a\\nfew seconds, has the B-Complex, C, and E vitamins virtually destroyed.\\nThe essential trace minerals are rendered useless. These vital nutrients\\nare important for stress reduction and the prevention of cancer and\\nheart disease. Eating microwaved food also causes lymphatic disorders.\\nThis is incredibly significant.

Cell tumors were also significantly higher. Eating\\nmicrowaved food has also been shown to increase high blood pres-\\nsure and cause symptoms such as migraines, dizziness, stomach pain,\\nstress, and anxiety. Other observed and reported problems included\\nhair loss, appendicitis, cataracts, infertility problems, abnormal hor-\\nmone levels, adrenal exhaustion, heart disease, memory loss, and\\nattention disorders. Also, crankiness, depression, and poor sleep.\\nThe Russian researchers stressed that eating microwaved food can\\nbe fatal. The energy produced in a microwave oven makes the food a\\npoison. Consider, however, that this energy is all around us. Similar\\nenergy is in your cell phone, and the new long-range cordless phones\\nradiating at a 2.45 gigahertz frequency is the same as your microwave\\noven. This microwave energy comes from computers, televisions, wire-\\nless devices, satellite transmissions, etc. This is why you NEED an elec-\\ntronic chaos eliminator.\\nEating the molecularly altered microwaved food alters your blood\\nchemistry as well. Consider this: Researchers have shown that if you\\neat organic vegetables that have been cooked in the microwave, your\\ncholesterol rapidly rises. Swiss scientists have discovered that blood\\ncholesterol is less influenced by how much cholesterol is in the food we\\neat, and more influenced by the molecular structure of the food itself.\\nAny food that comes out of a microwave oven will send your cholesterol\\nsoaring. A noted researcher has stated that the effects of microwaved\\nfood can be long-term, permanent, and fatal to the human body. The\\nminerals, vitamins, and nutrients of all microwaved food is reduced or\\ndramatically altered. The human body gets little or no benefit from the\\nneeded nutrients, and the human body absorbs these altered, newly\\nformed compounds that cannot be broken down and these compounds\\nhave a dramatic adverse affect on the entire physiology. This leads to\\ncancer, heart disease, diabetes, MS, muscular dystrophy, lupus, and vir-\\ntually every degenerative disease.\\nDr. Mercola agrees. \"Recent research shows that any food that\\ncomes out of a microwave oven suffers severe molecular damage.\\nWhen eaten it causes abnormal changes in human blood and immune\\nsystems.\" Not surprisingly, the public has been denied details on these\\nsignificant health dangers.\\nDon\\'t believe me yet?

There are many ways to clean your colon.\\nIf you go on the Internet and type in \"colon cleanse,\" there are dozens\\nof companies that sell herbal formulas or other type of ingestible-type\\nproducts that are effective at helping clean your colon. One of the most\\neffective and thorough ways to clean your colon is to purchase one of\\nthe herbal-type supplements that you take orally, while at the same\\ntime getting a series of colonies done by a certified colon therapist. Go\\nto your Yellow Pages under colon therapy or colonies, and you will see\\na list of people that you can consult with who can give you a number of\\ncolonies. An effective way to do this is get one colonic every other day\\nfor thirty days. While you are doing the colonies, also be taking a colon\\ncleanse product. It is also important to discuss with the colon thera-\\npist taking some type of friendly flora product, such as acidophilus, to\\nreplenish the flora as you are cleaning out the colon. If you do nothing\\nelse, but just do this one step for thirty days, I can almost guarantee you\\nthat you will lose a minimum of five pounds. I can tell you from personal\\nexperience that the majority of people who do this procedure lose, on\\naverage, ten pounds in thirty days. The most notable thing that occurs\\nis the person\\'s stomach flattens out, their energy level skyrockets, they\\nthink clearer, sleep better, and digest food much, much better. Colon\\nhealth is important. A dirty, clogged colonâwhich I can guarantee that\\nyou have right nowâcan lead to colon cancer, liver disease, diabetes,\\nand a host of other problems.

This is\\nthe bombshell. This is the eye-opener. The drugs cause your disease.\\nLet me give you one prime example of how drugs cause disease. A\\nlittle baby is born and immediately given a set of vaccinations. These\\nvaccinations are drugs. They are poisons. They are diseased chemi-\\ncals. You are injecting the little baby with viruses, drugs, chemicals,\\nand disease. The baby\\'s immune system begins to act in a totally\\nunnatural way and becomes very susceptible to bacteria. Virtually\\nevery child, then, gets infections, primarily an ear infection. These\\ninfections were caused by the vaccines themselves. The doctor then\\nprescribes more drugs in the form of antibiotics. These antibiotics are\\ndesigned to take care of the ear infection, but they cause a huge prob-\\nlem. The antibiotics kill all the friendly flora in the intestine, causing\\nthe bad flora, primarily Candida, to overgrow. This then carries on the\\nrest of the person\\'s life. The Candida yeast begins to overgrow, first\\nstarting in the intestine, then in the stomach, then through all the\\norgans the liver, spleen, pancreas, gall bladder, kidneys, up into the\\nlungs affecting glands such as the thyroid, and even into the brain. The\\nCandida begins to cause, or participate in the cause, of acid reflux,\\ndigestive disorders, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, thyroid\\nproblems, diabetes, liver problems, urinary tract infections, asthma,\\nand virtually every other major disease. As these symptoms come to\\nthe forefront, doctors simply prescribe more drugs. Every drug you\\ntake, whether it is a nonprescription drug or a prescription drug, will\\ncause you to be sicker. The drug causes illness and disease. The drugs\\ncause body imbalances.\\nIn my research it becomes clearer and clearer and clearer that if\\nyou put every single disease down and ask what caused that set of\\nsymptoms, and then ask what caused that set of symptoms, and then\\nask what caused that set of symptoms, it almost always goes back to\\nCandida and/or nonprescription and prescription drugs. Those are\\nthe two main root causes for almost all disease. The third major root\\ncause is your own mind. The stress and emotional challenges that you\\nstore in your mind. These are the big three. If you address these three\\nthings, virtually every single disease gets better or vanishes completely.\\nI have seen people with muscular dystrophy, MS, acid reflux, diabetes,\\nliver problems, chronic pain, arthritis, migraines, depression, anxiety,\\nasthma, and the list goes on, that have been cured by handling these\\nthree things.

They can .\\nVery simple stress-reducing techniques do in fact cure the incur-\\nable. The mind is the most powerful curing mechanism you have. The\\nplacebo effect proves that the mind can cure disease more effectively\\nthan anything else on the planet. This is why when people write me\\nand ask me what is the cure for this, or what is the cure for that, I\\nalways go back and say, \"Do the things in Chapter 6 first, then come\\nback to me in four or five months and tell me what symptoms you still\\nhave, if any.\" In most cases the people\\'s symptoms are gone. When\\npeople come up to me and ask me what the cure for their disease is,\\nwhat they are really asking is, \"I have these set of symptoms, and\\nI would like some natural remedy to alleviate the symptoms.\" The\\nproblem is, I can\\'t give you a natural remedy if you are continuing to\\ndo what is causing the symptoms. If you are taking nonprescription\\nand prescription drugs, if you still have Candida, or you still have stress\\nlodged in your mind, anything to alleviate the symptom is simply not\\ngoing to correct the problem in any significant way. When people come\\nup to me and say, \"I have acid reflux. What can be done?\" I then ask,\\n\"How many drugs are you on?\" They are on one, two, three, four or\\nmore. The answer is, \"I\\'ll tell you what. Get off all the drugs, do the\\nCandida cleanse, and then come back in two months and tell me if you\\nstill have acid reflux.\" If a person were to do that, their symptoms would\\nbe gone. They don\\'t understand that the reason they have acid reflux\\nis because the root cause of it has not been addressed. The root causes\\nof virtually all disease are nonprescription and prescription drugs. You\\nmust get off the drugs. The problem, though, is all the drugs you have\\ntaken since you were a baby have a residual effect. They do not leave\\nthe body 100 percent; much of the drug stays in the fatty tissues in the\\ncells, and you must get the drugs out. That is why I recommend doing a\\nCandida cleanse, a liver cleanse, a gall bladder cleanse, a colon cleanse,\\nand a full body-fat cleanse. This gets the toxins out.

You will also be able to read the\\ncomments of other people who have gone to those practitioners and\\nwhat they have said about them. You will be able to find practitioners\\nwho specialize in particular medical areas, or who specialize using\\nspecific types of medical treatments. Until then, a good way to find a\\ngood licensed alternative health-care practitioner in your area is go to\\nthe Yellow Pages and start with a chiropractor and ask them who they\\nknow who is a licensed health-care practitioner who uses herbs, or is a\\nnaturopath, or is a homeopath, or who uses energy work.

They are Super Size Me and What the Bleep Do We Know.\\nSuper Size Me is a very important documentary about an individual\\nwho decided to eat only McDonald's food for thirty days. It shows clearly\\njust how dangerous fast food is. When you watch the documentary, you\\nwill see that this man almost died in thirty days. He gained 28 pounds,\\nand the doctors who were monitoring his health said that whatever he\\nwas doing was killing him. This points out the fact that the fast-food\\nindustry is causing disease. It's not cheeseburgers or French fries that\\ngive you disease, it's the chemical poisons that are put in the food by the\\nfood manufacturers that cause the disease. A cheeseburger made with\\norganic ingredients is not unhealthy, but a cheeseburger at a fast-food\\nrestaurant categorically, 100 percent gives you disease. This documen-\\ntary proves the point.

What\\'s the truth here?\\nA: This is a prime example of the medical industry actively trying\\nto debunk all-natural remedies. The pharmaceutical industry has\\ntens of millions of dollars earmarked on a specific campaign. It\\nuses public relations firms, and front groups that appear to be con-\\nsumer advocacy groups, to get a certain message across and make\\nyou believe a certain thing. The message that the pharmaceutical\\ncompanies are spending tens of millions of dollars on is to make you\\nbelieve that all-natural remedies are ineffective and harmful, and\\nmake you believe that drugs are very effective and safe. The exact\\nopposite is true. Anytime you hear about a \"study\" that has been\\ndone on a natural product like Vitamin E, you are being misled.\\nThese \"studies\" are funded by the pharmaceutical industry\\nor by front groups for the pharmaceutical industry. They do not\\nuse the natural derivative. What they do is they take a chemical\\ncompound, which they say is identical to the main ingredient the\\nparticular vitamin or mineral. Then they do a \"study,\" and they\\ngive you the twisted, misleading results. The issues here are, first\\nand foremost, that they are not using the natural compound, they\\nare using a chemical derivative that was manufactured in the lab, it\\nis not Vitamin E. They are using a chemical derivative that they are\\ncalling Vitamin E. The studies are manufactured and misleading.\\nThe fact is all-natural Vitamin E is a spectacularly effective\\nfood supplement. It increases circulation and increases oxygen\\nthroughout the body. Men, for example, who have erectile dys-\\nfunction who take Vitamin E see a dramatic improvement in their\\ncondition. Vitamin E works better than the drug heprin as a blood\\nthinner preventing clots in the arteries. Vitamin E is incredible for\\nincreasing circulation, improving memory, concentration, as well\\nas helping healing throughout the body. Vitamin E put on wounds\\nincreases healing of cuts and sores dramatically.

People who are\\noverweight generally have a slow metabolism. In order to get your\\nmetabolism moving, one of the most important things you can do is eat\\na substantial breakfast.\\nThere are two elements here: (1) you must eat a substantial break-\\nfast, and (2) you must eat the right kinds of food that make your metab-\\nolism go up and get your body burning fat instead of eating food that\\ncauses your body to retain fat and gain weight. Is there a best breakfast?\\nWell, let's start with this basic premise: everything you eat for breakfast\\nmust be organic and unprocessed. It cannot, generally speaking, be out\\nof a box or from a company that is publicly traded. If you are eating\\nfood that you have purchased from a publicly traded corporation, I can\\nassure you that there are ingredients in the food that are not listed on\\nthe label. I can assure you that these companies are secretly putting\\ningredients in the food to increase your appetite, get you physically\\naddicted to the food, and make you fat.\\nSo, with that in mind, here are some good types of food that you\\ncan eat for breakfast:\\n1.Meats. Eat organic beef, lamb, chicken. Make sure these are real cuts\\nof meat and not deli-type meats or any type of processed meats.\\n2.Fish. Wild salmon, sardines, tuna, etc.\\n3.Fruits. Grapefruits, apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries, plums,\\npeaches, and apricots. Make sure the fruits are fresh and not dried.\\nAs always, make sure they are organic.\\nStay away from bananas as they have a tendency to make you gain\\nweight. If you must have milk with your breakfast, make sure it\\nis organic and ideally, raw milk that has not been pasteurized or\\nhomogenized.\\nHere are some common breakfasts that I eat:\\n1. Scrambled eggs with a side of smoked salmon, or lamb chops, or\\nsardines, or a small steak.\\nI make my scrambled eggs various ways. I always use fresh organic,\\nnon-pasteurized, fertile eggs.

There is no\\nway that you are not full of toxins throughout your entire body. If\\nyou have any illness or disease, one of the major reasons is that\\nyour body is toxic and cannot handle bacteria or viruses, thus\\ncausing you to become ill. The toxins also create an environment\\nwhere you cannot fully absorb nutrients, which means your body\\nis incapable of fighting off bacteria and viruses and you become\\nill. Toxins also block the energy flow throughout the body causing\\nyou to develop disease. Toxins themselves are poisons and, in fact,\\nallow you to develop a whole host of diseases and illnesses in the\\ngenetically weak areas of your body.\\nAs I explained in my book, you absolutely must clean out your\\nbody if you want to cure your diseases and prevent illness and disease\\nfrom occurring. There is no way around it. You must realize that in\\norder for you to be able to help cure your disease you must find out\\nwhat the cause of your disease is and solve that problem. If you are\\nsick right now with any kind of disease, one of the major causes of\\nyour illness is the fact that you are toxic. These toxins come from the\\nnonprescription and prescription drugs you have been taking your\\nentire life, including vaccines, the chemicals put in our food supply,\\nthe poisons in the water and the air, and the poisons you have put on\\nyour skin in the form of antiperspirants, lotions, etc., plus the toxins\\nyour body creates on its own primarily due to Candida and undigested\\nfood in your colon. There are many other causes of body toxicity. The\\nfact is, if you are sick, one of the causes is you are sick because you\\nare toxic.\\nWhen people come up to me with questions about their health\\nissues, people get frustrated when I say, \"Do the cleanses and come\\nback in two months and tell me if your symptoms or disease still', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The absolute best, most com-\\nplete Candida cleanse I know of is described in the book Lifeforce by\\nDr. Jeff McCombs.\\nThe last cleanse is what I call the full-body cleanse. This cleanse is\\nreally a cleanse that gets the toxins out of the fatty tissue throughout\\nthe entire body. It is done by taking certain supplements and sweat-\\ning the toxins out in a sauna. It provides some of the most incredible\\nhealth benefits any person can imagine. It takes from three to eight\\nweeks, depending on how toxic a person is. To get more information\\non this cleanse go to www.purification.org.\\nEveryone has different opinions on cleansing.

It does. Other people believe that rebounding\\nor doing exercise such as yoga increases circulation to the vital organs\\nand speeds cleansing and detoxification. They absolutely do. The\\nimportant thing is not to be overwhelmed by all the various cleanses\\nthat you can do. Start slow, but definitely start. The sooner you get\\nstarted, the sooner you will feel better.\\nIs there a best way to do cleanses? Are some cleanses better than\\nothers? The answers are, all cleanses are good.

And\\nthe FDA is actually saying that it, as an agency, is virtually defenseless\\nagainst a similar future catastrophe with another drug.\\nNon-prescription over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs\\nare in fact deadly and are killing people. The American medical asso-\\nciation itself admits that prescription drugs are now the fourth-leading\\ncause of death in America. Prescription drugs are actually killing more\\npeople than the disease that they are supposed to be curing. Folks, this\\nis just the tip of the iceberg. I will say this in every newsletter over and\\nover again; if you are taking non-prescription, over-the-counter drugs\\nor prescription drugs you absolutely must stop taking these drugs now.\\nHowever, I must warn you, only stop taking drugs under the supervi-\\nsion of a licensed health care practitioner. Many of these drugs are so\\npowerful that stopping to suddenly could cause medical problems, but\\nif you want to cure your disease, you must stop taking drugs. If you\\nwant to prevent disease, you must stop taking drugs. Remember drug\\ncompanies are publicly traded corporations, which means they have\\nonly one objective and that is to make money. The only way that drug\\ncompanies make money is by getting you to believe that you need to\\ntake drugs. Drug companies only make money by getting more people to\\ntake more drugs. If a drug company\\'s objective was to cure and prevent\\ndisease, they would all be out of business. You must remember that. If\\nyou watch any of the financial news networks such as CNBC, Bloomberg\\nor any of the cable stations that focus on publicly traded companies and\\nthe financial markets. You will see over and over again how drug com-\\npanies talk about their business. They do not talk about curing disease\\nand preventing disease, they talk about \"market share,\" \"profitability,\"\\n\"long term growth\" and new blockbuster drugs that will increase bot-\\ntom line profits. Read the Wall Street Journal, Investors Business Daily,\\nBusiness Week or any financial newspaper or magazine when you read\\narticles about the drug industry, they never talk about preventing and\\ncuring disease, they only talk about these companies ability to sell\\nmore drugs and increase profitability.\\nThey talk about the millions of dollars being put in lobbying efforts\\nto get congressmen to pass laws that the government itself buys drugs', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It\\'s all about the money. The fact is, if you\\nwant to prevent illness and disease and if you want to cure yourself\\nof illness and disease, you must stop taking over-the-counter non-pre-\\nscription drugs and prescription drugs. These drugs are actually giving\\nyou and causing disease, the facts are clear, you will hear more and\\nmore about this, as this information becomes uncovered. The drug\\ncompanies know it, the Food and Drug Administration knows it, but\\nthey are taking no action because there is too much money and profits\\ninvolved. Think about this, Vioxx has been voluntarily pulled from the\\nmarket by its manufacture the drug company Merck. It is categorically\\nproven now that 100,000 people have died because they took Vioxx. It\\nis estimated that over a million people may have had heart attacks and\\nstrokes because they took the prescription drug Vioxx. The drug com-\\npany Merck knew this would happen five years ago and so did the FDA.\\nThey took no action because of the massive amount of profit involved.\\nHere is the shocking truth, the FDA, as I write this newsletter, still\\nhas not banned Vioxx from the market! Think about that. Remember\\nin my book I talked about how the FDA banned the herb mahaung\\nbecause it contained ephedra. The FDA claimed that ephedra had\\nbeen linked to 153 deaths over a ten-year period, therefore concluded\\nthat the herb mahaung was too dangerous and must be banned from\\nthe American marketplace. Remember those deaths were linked to\\nephedra, not proven to be caused by ephedra. But the FDA still said\\nthey believed it showed that the herb was too dangerous and must be\\nbanned. However, Vioxx is now known to have killed over a 100,000\\npeople. Yet the FDA still has not taken any action and banned it from\\nthe market place. In the last few weeks there have been organizations\\nnow that have shown and proven that drug advertising has been false\\nand misleading. Where is the Federal Trade Commission??? They\\nhave yet to take any action against the drug companies for producing\\nfalse and misleading advertising. Where is the FDA??? They have yet\\nto have taken any action for these drug companies producing what is\\nnow proven to be false and misleading advertising. Remember in my\\nbook how I talk about how the FDA and the FTC only pick on the little\\nguys like myself, trying to crush us with massive lawsuits, asset freezes\\nand smear campaigns in the press. They try to put us out of business,\\nshut us down and shut us up.

All\\nthe major pharmaceutical companies in the United States announced\\ndisturbing news regarding product development in the drug industry.\\nTo compensate for the lack of new profitable drugs, drug companies\\ninstead use strategic advertising campaigns specifically designed to\\nincrease sales to both patients and doctors. They also hike up the\\nprices of prescription drugs to increase profitability. The lack of suc-\\ncessful drug research and development has been common knowledge to\\nthe scientists and researchers involved in the industry, according to a\\nUSA Today report. It is not until now that the companies have actually\\ngone public with this information. Drug companies have also publicly\\nannounced that they have concerns with the negative side effects and\\nan alarming high number of people who use many of the most popular\\nbrand named drugs such as Celebrex. It appears that the drug compa-\\nnies simply are not producing any new drugs that have any effectiveness\\nagainst disease. However, the drug companies seem to be remedying\\nthis situation by spending more money on marketing and advertising\\ntheir drugs than on research and development of new drugs. The phar-\\nmaceutical industry is now reaping record-breaking profits, specifically\\nbecause of their new slick advertising campaigns designed to convince\\nconsumers that they need to purchase drugs. \"If you don\\'t have a lot of\\nbreakthrough drugs in your pipeline and you are a drug company, you\\nneed to market the hell out of the drugs that you do have,\" Dr. Jerry\\nAvorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school and author\\nof Powerful Medicines: The Benefits, Risks and Costs of Prescription\\nDrugs, told USA Today. Consequently people are taking popular brand\\nname prescription drugs that have little or no effect on their medical\\nconditions and in fact, are causing more medical and health problems.\\nDr. Avorn went on to explain that companies are reluctant to vigilantly\\nmonitor the side effects of drugs because if consumers learn about the\\nnegative side effects that they will experience by taking these drugs, it\\ncould cut into the sales and profits of the drug companies and could\\nreduce sales of future drugs because customers will be concerned about\\ntheir safety and be reluctant to purchase them.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Remember that there is absolutely no follow up testing on the\\nsafety of drugs once it are approved by the FDA, this is a significant\\npoint. Once a drug, both a non-prescription over-the-counter drug or\\na prescription drug is approved by the FDA there is virtually no follow\\nup testing to see if the drug actually works and is safe. Keep in mind\\nwhen the FDA approves a drug, it is relying on research that has been\\nbought and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies. The commit-\\ntees that are reviewing the drug are usually filled with doctors that\\nare on the payroll of the drug company whose drug is up for review.\\nThis means conflict of interest, conflict of interest, conflict of interest.\\nAlso, when big profitable drugs are approved, many of the FDA people\\ninvolved in that approval process resign from the FDA and go to work\\ndirectly for that drug company and are paid millions of dollars. Payoff,\\npayoffs, payoffs! Then once that drug is approved, there is absolutely\\nno further review on whether or not that drug actually works and is\\nsafe. This is why today more people are sicker than ever before in his-\\ntory yet we take more drugs than ever before in history. Drugs do not\\nwork at preventing and curing disease they cause disease.\\nThe Cause of All Illness and Disease\\nI want to be very clear about what the cause of virtually all illness and\\ndisease is. If you are sick, if you have any type of illness or disease, the\\nonly way you can cure yourself of the illness or disease that you have is\\nto understand what the causes are. All illnesses and disease are caused\\nby the same things; (1) too many toxins in the body; (2) nutritional\\ndeficiencies; (3) electromagnetic chaos exposure; (4) mental and/or\\nemotional stress. Let\\'s go back to the basics: There are really only\\ntwo ways you get sick. One, you catch something, or two, you develop\\nsomething. If you catch something, such as a germ, a virus or a bacteria,\\nyou will only succumb to that germ, bacteria or virus if your immune\\nsystem is weak. If your immune system is strong, all the viruses and\\nbacteria that you are exposed to are fought off by the killer cells in your\\nbody. The fact is, you are exposed to hundreds of germs on a regular\\nbasis, and this is totally natural. Your body then releases killer cells,\\nwhich go and attack, kill, and wipe out the various invading viruses\\nand bacteria and germs. However, if your immune system is weak,\\nthen you succumb to that virus, bacteria or germ and develop sick-', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

What causes your immune system to be weak? Well, toxins in\\nthe body, nutritional deficiencies, electromagnetic chaos, mental and/\\nor emotional stress. The second reason you are sick is you develop\\nsomething in your body such as cancer, or diabetes or clogged arteries.\\nYou don\\'t catch these thingsâyou develop them. Why do you develop\\nthem? Well, you develop them because of too many toxins, nutritional\\ndeficiencies, electromagnetic chaos, or mental and emotional stress.\\nPeople always ask me, where do genetics play into this? We all come\\ninto this world with certain genetic weaknesses; however, if you don\\'t\\nhave many toxins, if you have no nutritional deficiencies, if you are\\nnot exposed to electromagnetic chaos, and if you aren\\'t exposed to\\nmental and emotional stress, these genetic weaknesses actually cor-\\nrect themselves and never manifest. They only manifest themselves\\nwhen you have one of the four things that I have mentioned.\\nPeople always want to know what the natural cure is for their dis-\\nease, and the fact of the matter is the natural cure for every disease is\\nabsolutely the same thing. No matter what disease you have, whether\\nit\\'s cancer, heart disease, diabetes, fibromyalgia, allergies, asthma,\\nacne, dandruff, eczema, herpes, acid reflux, constipation, colitis, PMS,\\ninfertility, erectile dysfunction, etc., etc., etc. The cure is the same\\nbecause the cause is the same. No matter what disease or illness you\\nhave, one of, or a combination of, these four things causes it:\\n1.You have toxins in your body;\\n2.You have nutritional deficiencies;\\n3.You have exposure to electromagnetic chaos; and\\n4.You have mental and/or emotional stress.\\nSince that is in fact the cause of all illness and disease, the cure\\nis simply to correct these imbalances. Let me go through each one of\\nthese and show you the simplest way to correct it. Keeping in mind\\nthe umbrella to this whole thing is when you have corrected these\\nfour issues your body pH will be alkaline, and when your body pH is\\nalkaline, you virtually can never get sick.

Toxins.\\nYou are toxic. That\\'s factual; there is no way around it. The\\nnumber-one toxin you have put in your body over the years are\\nnon-prescription over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs.\\nThis started from the moment you were born. When your mother\\nwent into the hospital and was given drugs in the operating room\\nwhen you were delivered; then when you were delivered you were\\npumped full of drugs by the doctors; then you were pumped full of\\nvaccines; then you were pumped full of antibiotics all within the\\nfirst year of your life. For the rest of your life you were pumped\\nfull of drug after drug after drug after drug. You were fed food from\\ncans, boxes, and jars. All of the food has been loaded with chemi-\\ncals, poisons, and toxins. The air you breathe is full of chemicals,\\npoisons, and toxins. The water you drink, bathe, swim in, and\\nshower in is loaded with poisons, toxins, and chemicals. You didn\\'t\\nknow any better and depending on where you lived and what you\\nate, determined how many toxins were put into your body. It isn\\'t\\na matter of if you put toxins in your body; it\\'s just a matter of how\\nmuch. As I mentioned, the genetically weak areas will begin to dete-\\nriorate first. That\\'s why two people can do exactly the same thing\\nand one person will be dead at 40 years old and the other person can\\nlive to be 100. Why is it that two people can smoke cigarettes, side\\nby side, and one person drop dead at 40 from cancer and the other\\none live to be 100 and never have any cancer? They were both put-\\nting in the same amount of toxins, but one person had genetics that\\nwere strong in those specific areas and didn\\'t succumb to the toxins\\nin the cigarettes, and the other person had genetic weaknesses and\\nsuccumbed very quickly. In order to cure yourself of disease and\\nnever get sick again you have to do two things.\\nA. You have to get rid of and clean out the toxins that are in your\\nbody.

Reduce the number of toxins you are putting in your body; you\\ncan certainly reduce them. There are a multitude of ways of reduc-\\ning them. For example, get a shower filter, so you are not shower-\\ning and bathing in toxic-filled water. Get a water filter and drink\\nmore water. Drinking pure, filtered water will cleanse toxins out of\\nyour body. Eat only organic fruits, vegetables, and meat, therefore\\nreducing the amount of toxins you are putting into your body.\\nStop taking any non-prescription, over-the-counter drugs and all\\nprescription drugs. Get an air filter in your house, especially your\\nbedroom. Stop eating things that are filled with toxins such as fast\\nfood, food from chain restaurants, food in boxes, packages, cans,\\nand jars that are sold by publicly traded corporations. Buy only\\norganic. There is a whole list of things in Chapter 6 of my book on\\nhow to reduce the amount of toxins you are putting in your body.\\nAgain, you can never stop totally, but you can certainly reduce and\\nthen every year or so you can do a cleanse to clean out the toxins\\nthat you have been putting in.\\n2. Nutritional Deficiencies.\\nEvery single person has nutritional deficiencies. When you are\\ndeficient in vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and other nutrients your\\nbody cannot operate at optimal levels, thus causing illness and\\ndisease because your immune system cannot operate efficiently.\\nIn my opinion, the two most important nutrients you can have are\\nVitamin E and the mineral calcium. I believe that these are the\\ntwo most important and significant nutrients that you need to be\\nsupplementing your diet with. I believe that every single person\\nis deficient in Vitamin E and deficient in calcium. I believe that\\nthese two specific deficiencies lead to a variety of illness, and by\\nsupplementing your diet with these two nutrients you can prevent\\nvirtually all illness and disease and cure yourself of most illness\\nand disease. However, there is a big caveat to these statements.

And also containing d-beta, d-gamma, and d-delta\\ntocopherols for synergistic antioxidant protection against harmful free\\nradical damage and perioxynitrates damaging to brain cells, and also\\ncontaining tocopherols in a non-genetically modified source. You do\\nnot want the synthetic dl form and not the esterified tocopherol ace-\\ntate or succinate, not the ordinary soy oil diluted mixed tocopherols\\nor adulterated forms. You want the Vitamin E, which contains all four\\ncomponents for the powerful synergistic effects as nature intended.\\nYou do not want a Vitamin E with added soy oil or other oil fillers,\\nwhich can turn rancid and cause harmful free radical damage. You do\\nnot want one with added preservatives, colors, or flavorings.\\nWhen you take this Vitamin E you should take one capsule for every\\nthirty pounds of total body weight just before or with your morning meal.\\nYou take it all in one dose.

I\\'ve had people who had varicose veins and phlebitis vanish in\\nas little as two or three days. I\\'ve seen people who had manic depres-\\nsion had it reversed in an incredibly short period of time. Men, and even\\nwomen, with sexual problems have it reversed in a matter of weeks as\\nVitamin E increases circulation and oxygenation to all the cells.\\nVitamin E increases circulation and oxygenation to the body,\\nthus increases the absorption of all nutrients to the cells, as well as\\nincreases the ability of cells to eliminate toxins. It is one of the master\\nnutrients that are needed for optimum health. It prevents heart dis-\\nease and clogged arteries. The list of health benefits goes on.\\nThe master mineral that everyone is deficient in is calcium. Like\\nVitamin E, our food source has been depleted of calcium. Also, much\\nof the food we consume, such as carbonated drinks and coffee, as well\\nas prescription and non-prescription drugs, block calcium absorption.\\nTherefore, I can categorically assure you that you are calcium deficient.\\nCalcium, in my opinion, is the most important mineral in the body.\\nWhen you are deficient in calcium, nothing else works well. Increasing\\ncalcium to the level that it is supposed to be and eliminating the defi-\\nciency does wonderful things to the body. It increases oxygen to all the\\ncells, and increases the ability for electric energy to flow better through-\\nout the entire body. Like Vitamin E, it allows the cells to detoxify quicker\\nand faster, and allows nutrients to get into the cells quicker and faster.\\nIt relieves stress and is a major element needed to keep the body alka-\\nline. Research shows that bringing calcium levels back to normal makes\\nweight loss happen faster and easier.\\nLike Vitamin E, there are many kinds of calcium. In my opinion,\\nyou must get a form of calcium that is the most absorbable and useable\\nin the body. I believe that marine grade coral calcium from Okinawa,\\nJapan, is one of the best forms of calcium you can take. There are\\nmany brands available. If the label says marine grade coral calcium\\nfrom Okinawa, Japan, you should be okay with that product. There are\\nonly a few manufacturers in America that make coral calcium. These\\nmanufacturers make the coral calcium for hundreds of various resellers.\\nAll the coral comes from Japan as long as it says from Okinawa, Japan.\\nThere are two grades available. One is marine grade, which comes from\\nin the ocean, and the other one is non-marine grade, which comes from\\nthe sand on the beach.

There is also coral calcium in sachets\\nthat you put in water that helps calcify the water. This is excellent,\\nespecially for people who do not like to take pills. Again, always look for\\nmarine grade coral calcium from Okinawa, Japan.\\nThose are the two most important nutrients you need to supplement\\nyour diet with, but I can categorically assure you that you are deficient\\nin a whole host of other nutrients as well. Taking a whole food supple-\\nment, or drinking fresh organic fruit and vegetable juice, can solve this\\nproblem. The best way to relieve yourself of nutritional deficiencies is to\\ndrink pure organic fruit and vegetable juice. This way you are receiving\\nall the nutrients in the most absorbable form in the exact proportion\\nthat nature intended. You need to get a good juice machine for this\\npurpose. I have tried dozens of juice extractors and I believe that the\\nbest juice extractor is the one you will actually use. That means the\\nbest juice extractor is the one that is easy to use and easy to clean. I\\nhave used dozens personally, and I can assure you that if it isn't easy\\nto use and easy to clean, it doesn't get used. Therefore, it is useless. I\\ncan't tell you the brand that I use, but e-mail the licensed health-care\\npractitioners and ask the question and they will send you their recom-\\nmendations. They use the same juice extractors that I do.\\nBy the way, a Vita-Mix is not a juice extractor. I own a Vita-Mix and\\nit is a very good blender and has a lot of very good uses, but it is not\\na juice extractor. A juice extractor extracts the juice from the fruit,\\nseparating the juice from the pulp. A Vita-Mix, being a very powerful\\nblender, simply liquefies the entire fruit or vegetable. This is not juice;\\nthis is a liquefied fruit or vegetable. It's not bad, but it is not juice.\\nThat's why I recommend a juice extractor. For those of you who want\\nmore convenience, as I mentioned in last month's newsletter, you can\\nenjoy mangosteen juice, goji juice, or noni juice. Although these juices\\nare in many cases reconstituted or come from concentrate and are\\npasteurized, they are still packed with incredible amounts of vitamins,\\nminerals, and cofactors and are very effective ways of handling your\\nnutritional deficiencies.\\nThe next-best way to handle nutritional deficiencies is by taking\\na whole-food supplement. Whole-food supplements are not by defini-\\ntion vitamins and minerals, but are in fact concentrated whole-food\\nsources. I can't mention brand names, but I will tell you a couple of\\nspecific things. Chiorella is an excellent whole food source.

Luckily, it\\nwon\\'t take the same amount of time to reverse, but it will take weeks or\\nmonths. Be patient, but do these things and you will see results.\\n3.Electromagnetic Chaos\\nYou can\\'t avoid electromagnetic chaos; it\\'s impossible. It\\'s around us,\\nfrom the laptop computers, to our TVs, the satellites in the sky, cell\\nphones, any and all wireless devices, radar transmissions, high-ten-\\nsion power lines, electrical lines, and fiber optic networks.

You can\\nreduce it by eliminating all wireless devices from your home, but\\nseriously, you may only be able to reduce it a little. Therefore, in\\nmy opinion, it is categorically imperative that you have an electronic\\nchaos eliminator. There are several brands available, each purport-\\ning to be the best and most effective. In my initial research, I believe\\nthat they are all effective to varying degrees. Which one is the most\\npowerful and the best? I do not know. Once I do know, I will let you\\nknow.

I have seen personally\\nmedical miracles happen right before my eyes from people who\\nuse techniques to eliminate unconscious, hidden, trapped negative\\nemotions.

To get information on Dr. Coldwell's technolo-\\ngies please e-mail licensed health-care practitioner Dr. Hohn at\\ndrhohn@goodlifefoundation.com.\\nIf you want to cure yourself of the disease you have, you have\\nto understand the cause of those diseases, and all diseases are\\ncaused by the same four things. When you understand that, then\\nyou will understand how your body works, why you are sick, and\\nwhat you can do to correct the problem. I can absolutely tell you\\nthis, if you cure yourself of your diseases by using these techniques\\nand you continue to use these techniques, it will be almost impos-\\nsible for you to be sick in the future. If you ever do come down with\\nany type of cold, flu, or illness, the symptoms will be mild and the\\nduration will be very short, and the likelihood of you coming down\\nwith some serious debilitating disease is almost zero.

That means not just\\nfruits and vegetables, but all food including meat. Eating organic meat\\nis probably even more important than eating organic fruits and veg-\\netables. There has been a second reported case of Mad Cow Disease in\\nCanada. This is significant because I can assure you that if there have\\nbeen two reported cases of Mad Cow Disease, that means that there\\nare thousands and thousands of cows that have Mad Cow Disease that\\nhave not been reported. I believe that cows in America have Mad Cow\\nDisease and are not being reported. The information is being sup-\\npressed and hidden from you.\\nIf you are eating regular conventional beef, you are an absolute\\ninsane crazy person because I believe you are eating meat that is\\nhighly diseased. The meat industry in America is producing some of\\nthe most toxic dangerous substances that we are putting in our body\\nand calling it food. Almost all meat in this country, with the exception\\nof kosher organic, is diseased and poisoned. All meat comes from cows\\nthat have been genetically modified, which means they are something\\nthat you don\\'t find in nature; almost all meat are fed products that are\\ninorganic, chemically laced, and diseased; almost all of these vegetar-\\nian cows are being fed ground-up other animal parts, including horses,\\ncows, chickens, other cows, goats, and pigs.\\nMuch of the ground-up animal parts that are being fed to our cattle\\nand dairy cows are in fact highly diseased and were so sick and were\\nso diseased that they couldn\\'t be slaughtered for human consumption,\\nso they were in fact ground up and fed to other cows that are in turn', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Here\\nis what people are saying about the book:\\n\"Anyone who thinks the meat on their plate is safe is liv-\\ning in a fantasy world. When the public sees this book, there\\nwill be hell to pay. \"âGeorge Knapp, Emmy Award-winning\\njournalist\\n\"This well-documented, accessible tale is the wake-up\\ncall that could literally safe your life. \"âJohn L.

Even scientific\\nresearch believes that as high as 13 percent of diagnosed Alzheimer\\'s\\ncases may actually be not Alzheimer\\'s at all, but another brain disease\\ncalled CJD, which is directly linked to Mad Cow. This book exposes how\\nMad Cow Disease has jumped species, infecting humans in the form of\\nCJD and may be causing a whole myriad of physical, mental, and emo-\\ntional problems in human beings that are being totally misdiagnosed,\\nincluding depression, fibromyalgia, MS, and dozens of other illnesses.\\nThis book is absolutely a must read. When you read this book, you will\\nbe riveted and fascinated about how the American meat industry works,\\nhow the USDA works, and how in fact that our meat supply is probably\\nsome of the worst, most diseased meat in the world.

If you do not spend time\\nin the sun you will be sick. The sun is vital for health, longevity and to\\nbe disease free. If you are sick, one of the things that you must do is\\nget out in the sun. I can tell you this, that the sun itself can virtually\\ncure disease. Every living thing on the planet, with rare exception,\\ncannot live without solar energy from the sun. Virtually every living\\nthing on Planet Earth needs the sun to survive. (There are rare excep-\\ntions to this, of course.) The human body needs sunlight to function at\\noptimal levels and be healthy. Without sunlight, a whole host of physi-\\ncal abnormalities and diseases become prevalent. Without sunlight\\nyou develop diseases, including depression, lack of energy, poor sleep,\\npoor digestion, weight gain, arthritis, constipation, bad breath, body\\nodor, cancer, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, atten-\\ntion deficit disorder, stress, headaches, susceptibility to colds, Plus and\\nviral infections, PMS, male erectile dysfunction, loss of sexual desire in\\nwomen, infertility, anxiety and more.

No. One of\\nthe things that the sun does is draw out from the body toxins to the\\nskin. It also stimulates cell re-growth, which actually makes you look\\nyounger and keeps your skin wrinkle free. Why is it then that people\\nwho spend hours and hours in the sun have a tendency to have dried-\\nout skin and wrinkled skin and look older than they are? The reason\\nis because they are so toxic. When your body is toxic, the sun will\\ndraw out from that body and bring those toxins to the surface. This is\\na good thing. It helps you cleanse and detoxify your system, keeping\\nyou young, beautiful and healthy.\\nHowever, if you are nutrient deficient, specifically in the good oils\\nand fats that you need in your diet, excessive or prolonged exposure\\nto the sun can cause these problems. The solution? Very simple, you\\nabsolutely need sun for health and longevity. However, unless you are\\npretty much toxic free, have no nutritional deficiencies, are balancing\\nyour electromagnetic chaos and are stress free, excessive exposure\\nover a long period of time can make your skin look leathery, dry and\\nwrinkly. Therefore, the solution is to first and foremost do the things\\nin Chapter 6 of the book. I believe this will make sure that you are\\ntoxic free, that you do not have nutritional deficiencies, that you are\\nbalancing the electromagnetic chaos around your body and that your\\nstress levels are dramatically reduced. Therefore, you can spend as\\nmuch time in the sun as you want and it will benefit you. There is a\\ncaveat to this: Every person\\'s pigment is different and will \"burn\" at\\na different level. Obviously, use common sense. If you are pale white\\nand haven\\'t been out in the sun in years, don\\'t go out in the sun in the\\nmiddle of the day for four hours.

I have seen and heard\\nof hundreds of people that have virtually cured themselves of major\\ndiseases by simply sunbathing and sun gazing. This sounds incredible\\nto some people. It sounds crazy and ludicrous to some people. The\\nfacts are that you can cure and prevent almost all diseases by sun gaz-\\ning and sunbathing.

There is a financial\\nconflict of interest here. I do not sell any products; therefore, I can\\ngive you an honest opinion. If you come to my house you will see that I\\nhave a cabinet full of nutritional supplements. I am constantly observ-\\ning others and personally testing nutritional supplements on myself. I\\nam constantly doing individual research on nutritional supplements to\\nsee how effective they are. I pick up the phone and I call these com-\\npanies and talk to the presidents and CEOs and investigate how these\\nproducts are manufactured, and if they do work. I see if the people\\nselling them are passionately behind the product or they are doing\\nit \"just for the money.\" Here is one of the most shocking truths. Did\\nyou know that the presidents and senior executives of almost every\\nvitamin and mineral company DO NOT TAKE THE VITAMINS AND\\nMINERALS THEY SELL! That\\'s right. They and their families do not\\neven take the vitamins that they are trying to get you to buy. This is\\nshocking, but true. However, even though I say do not take vitamins\\nand minerals, I also say in my book that you have nutritional deficien-\\ncies. I say in my book that you are deficient in vitamins and minerals,\\nenzymes and other various cofactors. I believe that nutritional defi-\\nciencies are one of the major causes of illness and disease. So what I\\nsay is you need to handle the nutritional deficiencies. But, you can\\'t\\nhandle them by taking vitamins and minerals.\\nThe best way to handle nutritional deficiencies is to clean out all the\\ntoxins in your body by doing the various cleanses that I recommend. This\\nwill allow you to absorb more nutrients and handle much of the nutri-\\ntional deficiencies you are experiencing.\\nI also suggest that you stop eating food that is toxic and lacking\\nnutrition, such as food from fast-food restaurants and non-organic\\nfruits, vegetables, meat and other products.\\nI also suggest that you buy a good juice machine and drink one or\\ntwo glasses of fresh juice a day made with organic fruit and/or vegeta-\\nbles.

Therefore, it is vital to eliminate or reduce your nutri-\\ntional deficiencies. Whole-food supplements are a good solution.\\nWhat are whole-food supplements? Well, I cannot give you specific\\nproduct brand names.

The FTC has disregarded their first and foremost\\nobligation to promote the truth.\"\\nEven the headline of the release was misleading, Bradford said.\\nIt stated that Mr. Trudeau has been banned from airing infomercials,\\nimplying a total ban. In fact, there is no total ban; indeed, Mr. Trudeau\\nis currently airing one of the most successful infomercials of all time, for\\na book which is critical of the FTC.\\nThe lawsuits accordingly charge the FTC with retaliation against Mr.\\nTrudeau. In his publications, and in a highly popular series of TV info-\\nmercials, Trudeau has bluntly criticized federal agencies and the FTC in\\nparticular, for working with the pharmaceutical industry to stifle discus-\\nsion and marketing of natural food and medicine alternatives.\\nMr. Trudeau is the author of Natural Cures \"They\" Don\\'t Want You\\nto Know About, which discusses natural remedies for common ail-\\nments and diseases that don\\'t involve expensive drugs or high-priced\\nmedical consultation. The book has become a best-seller.\\nIn one suit, Mr. Trudeau seeks a declaratory judgment that the FTC\\'s\\nnews release is false and misleading, that the FTC has exceeded its\\nauthority, and that the FTC has wrongfully sought to chill Mr. Trudeau\\'s\\nexercise of his First Amendment rights. That suit seeks an injunctive\\norder requiring the FTC to cease its wrongful conduct and correct its\\nmisleading statements. Mr. Trudeau\\'s second suit seeks unspecified\\nmonetary damages for injury to his business.\\n\"This breach of contract is so bald-faced that it can only represent\\na concerted attempt by the government to put Kevin out of business,\"\\nsaid Kimball Anderson, a lawyer with Winston & Strawn who also rep-\\nresents Mr. Trudeau. \"Their news release repeats charges that, in the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Do not simply try to suppress symptoms. Drugs only suppress\\nsymptoms, and they cause disease because they are toxic. It is also\\nimportant to remember that no matter what disease you have, there is\\nno one cure for a disease because what caused your particular disease\\nmay be different than what caused another person who had the same\\ndisease. Example: If ten people came to me with Multiple Sclerosis and\\nasked, \"What\\'s the cure?\" There is no one cure for Multiple Sclerosis.\\nEach of those ten people could have the symptoms of Multiple\\nSclerosis, but those symptoms could be caused by different factors.\\nOne person\\'s symptoms of MS could be caused by his laptop computer\\nor eating microwaved food. Another person\\'s symptoms of MS could be\\ncaused by a Candida yeast overgrowth. Another person\\'s symptoms of\\nMS could be caused by heavy metal toxicity. Another person\\'s symp-\\ntoms of MS could be caused by Aspartame. Another person\\'s symp-\\ntoms of MS could be caused by some prescription or nonprescription\\ndrug they are currently taking or have taken over the years. Another\\nperson\\'s symptoms of MS could be caused by some stress or trauma in\\nthat individual\\'s life. Another person\\'s symptoms of MS could simply\\nbe a nutritional deficiency.

I recommend seeing several licensed health-care\\npractitioners on a regular basis to keep you healthy and not just treat\\nyou when you\\'re sick. I believe it\\'s important to see several people\\nbecause each person looks at you from a different viewpoint and uses\\na different set of background knowledge and facts to give you certain\\nrecommendations to keep you healthy or cure your disease.\\nThe fact is you must get rid of toxins if you want to remain healthy\\nor cure yourself of disease. It is obvious that toxins cause disease, but\\nmost people that I talk to don\\'t believe that they are toxic. Let\\'s look\\nat the research; let\\'s look at the facts. Virtually every kind of food you\\neat in a restaurant is loaded with chemicals. The air is loaded with\\nchemicals and poisons. The water you bathe in and shower in is load-\\ned with chemicals and poisons being absorbed into your body. Every\\nlotion, cream, toothpaste, shampoo, soap is loaded with poisons and\\nchemicals going into your body. Every nonprescription and prescrip-\\ntion drug you have taken over your life is a chemical that has been\\nput in your body, etc., etc., etc. These toxins and chemicals do not\\ncome out of your body; they stay in you and create a residual build-\\ning up effect, which causes you to be sick and prone to disease. It was\\nrecently reported that rocket-fuel chemicals were found in mothers\\'\\nmilk. The Associated Press reported, \"A toxic chemical used in rocket\\nfuel was found in virtually every sample taken in a new study of nurs-\\ning mothers\\' milk.\" The report went on to say that rocket-fuel chemi-\\ncals were also found in virtually every sample of dairy milk tested that\\nwas pulled from grocery store shelves. These deadly chemicals have\\nalso been found in drinking water supplies in 35 states and also in veg-\\netables! This should help convince you that you are absolutely full of\\npoison chemicals and toxins. This is why the number-one thing I say\\nto do is to clean the toxins out of your body and stop putting toxins in\\nyour body. If you want to remain healthy, this is an absolute must.\\nMore On DMSO\\nI mentioned in a previous newsletter that DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is\\ncolorless, nontoxic water soluble liquid derived from wood pulp. DMSO\\ncomes in very small molecules and has the unique ability to permeate\\nthe skin and cells very quickly. It is a powerful solvent of both inorganic\\nand organic material.

This is because it penetrates so quickly and travels throughout the\\nbody so rapidly. DMSO also pulls in water at an incredible rate. It has\\nsuch a powerful attraction to water that it can even pull it out of the\\natmosphere. When you combine DMSO\\'s ability to penetrate and attract\\nwater you can see why it travels throughout the body so rapidly. It is\\nimportant to know that DMSO is used throughout the world as a medi-\\ncal treatment for many afflictions, including arthritis, head and spinal\\ninjuries, infectious diseases, cataracts, asthma, sinusitis, diabetes,\\nsciatica, cancer, stroke, herpes simplex and much, much more. It has\\nbeen known to inhibit bacterial growth, viruses and fungi. At Hospital\\nSanta Monica in Rosario Beach, Mexico, Dr. Curt W. Donsbach uses\\nDMSO and hydrogen peroxide intravenously on virtually every can-\\ncer patient with reportedly remarkable success. This appears to be\\nbecause cancer cannot survive in an oxygen-rich environment. Both\\nDMSO and hydrogen peroxide get oxygen into the body very quickly.\\nIt helps alkalize the body\\'s pH. As I mentioned before, the FDA will not\\nallow the use of DMSO for the treatment of disease because it is not\\na patentable drug. This is done not to protect patients, but to protect\\nthe profits of the drug companies. There is a great book written by\\nWilliam Fharel which talks a lot about DMSO and hydrogen peroxide.\\nIt is called Never an Outbreak, and I highly recommend it.

Other diets\\nconsist of stimulants such as caffeine or direct diuretics. I managed to\\nlose about 15 pounds of my excess 45 pounds through periodic calorie\\ncounting and fasting. However, my real weight loss came early in the\\n\\'70s, not as a result of some fad diet or doctor\\'s treatment but because,\\nof all things, a bread my wife had accidentally invented.\\nIt all started when a book was submitted to me for promotional pur-\\nposes. The book was about a Himalayan civilization called the Hunzas,\\nwhich is reported to be one of the three longest-living civilizations on\\nearth. In reading the book, the one thing that fascinated me was that\\nthe majority of the Hunza diet consisted of various forms of whole wheat\\nbread. I asked my wife, Nancy, to duplicate one of their bread recipes.\\nIn trying to duplicate the recipe, she made two alterations, one unknow-\\ningly. First, the bread would not rise properly, so she would let it set for\\nsix hours in order to get maximum rising, which was not called for in\\nthe recipe. Second, she had unknowingly added too much honey to the\\nrecipe because she would always let her measuring cup overflow, which\\ndid not seem significant, but later our measurements showed that this\\ndoubled and tripled the honey content.\\nThe original purpose of the bread was to eat it for nutritional pur-\\nposes. It intrigued me that this type of whole wheat bread was a staple\\nof one of the three longest-living civilizations on earth.

Bread, for some reason, has become a no-no for\\nlow-calorie diets due to the ignorance of the diet inventors over the\\npast two decades.\\nThe bread my wife produced was a very tasty bread to say the least.\\nWe started to include it in our regular diet, and we did start feeling\\nbetter, possibly from the combination of the nutritional value and the\\nfact that a high-fiber diet aids regularity, which more and more tests\\nare proving to be a valid factor for good health. But, unexpectedly,\\nsomething else happened. For some reason, when we ate the bread, we\\nlost our appetite. In fact, it got to the point where we did not eat the\\nbread before meals. With this factor in mind, I started using the bread\\nas a diet aid and, astonishingly, I lost the balance of my 30 pounds of\\nexcess weight. But that wasn't the best part. Not only did I lose the\\nweight, I kept it off. Unlike stimulants or diets, which throw your body\\nchemistry out of kilter, the bread was a perfectly natural, healthful\\naddition to the diet, and it could be used indefinitely. Simultaneously\\nseveral universities announced tests that concluded that whole wheat\\nbread was indeed a food that promoted weight loss.\\nAlso during this period of time, ITT Continental Baking Company\\nintroduced Fresh Horizons Bread, which were extra high-fiber white\\nand whole wheat breads. They even went so far as to promote it to\\ndoctors much the same way you would promote a prescription drug.\\nBut neither whole wheat bread nor Fresh Horizons Bread worked\\nnearly as well as my wife's bread. Because my wife's bread took a great\\ndeal of time to make; many times we ran out. We kept trying to sub-\\nstitute whole wheat bread or Fresh Horizons bread, but it just did not\\nwork anywhere near as well.\\nThen, one day we were talking to a friend who had been telling us\\nabout all the unsuccessful diets she had gone through. Then the idea\\nhit me. Why not promote my wife's bread as a diet aid?\\nOne drawback was that food was not in our area of expertise. But,\\nas far as dieting and producing the bread, we certainly were more\\nthan experts. After lengthy deliberation, I felt that the good points of\\npromoting the bread outweighed the bad points. We decided to start\\nmarketing the bread, initially by mail, of all things.\\nThe first step mandatory to marketing the bread was to have docu-\\nmented tests that showed it was indeed an appetite suppressant.

It worked for us and many of our friends. We first tried\\ngoing to testing laboratories and were very surprised to find that there\\nwere few, if any, who specialized in this sort of testing. Secondly those\\nwho were willing to look into it were talking astronomical figures in the\\nneighborhood of $500,000 to a million dollars. That was totally out of\\nline. I had my degree in psychology, so I was well versed in statistics\\nand testing. I knew that no such test could ever amount to that sum of\\nmoney.\\nI decided to test the bread myself using employees from companies\\nwith whom we did business as test subjects. We didn\\'t tell them it was\\nour bread, but a new product someone else brought to us. The results\\nwere astounding. Test subjects reported appetite satisfaction from eat-\\ning my wife\\'s bread, of anywhere from two to 24 hours, with an average\\nof five and one-half hours.\\nThe bread, of course, affected each person differently and affected\\neach individual person differently at different periods. Body metabo-\\nlisms change periodically depending on stress, emotions, activity, etc.\\nAt this point, we didn\\'t know exactly why the bread worked, but\\nlater lab tests were to disclose many of the reasons. Some of the rea-\\nsons it works still remain a mystery today.\\nThe first known reason it works is commonly called the Ayds prin-\\nciple, based on a court case won by Ayds, which demonstrated that\\nadding a quick shot of carbohydrates to the bloodstream suppresses\\nappetite. Our bread even goes one better. The long rising process\\ncaused the bread to have a high degree of carbohydrate breakdown.\\nCarbohydrates come in many molecular forms. But, in order to enter\\nthe bloodstream, it has to be broken down to a one-molecule carbohy-\\ndrate, technically called a monosaccharide carbohydrate. Also, almost\\nall honey is already a monosaccharide carbohydrate. The breakdown\\nof the bread itself and the fact that it contains an excess amount of\\nhoney or a great deal of monosaccharide carbohydrates that enter the\\nblood stream quickly reduces the appetite.\\nThe second known reason is that being a whole wheat bread it con-\\ntains a great deal of fiber. Fiber is chewy, and, once it is in the digestive\\ntract, it expands. While it is in the digestive tract, it causes food to move\\nthrough the tract more rapidly, thus decreasing calorie absorption.\\nA third factor that makes the bread effective is that the bread never\\nrises properly, and it is very heavy. The most common comment about\\nthe bread, after eating it, is, \"I feel like I have a brick in my stomach.\"', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It satisfies a wide range of cravings, for it contains the three\\nbasic body materials of fat, protein and carbohydrates. It is also eaten\\nhot with a hot beverage, which is satisfying.\\nA fifth explanatory factory involves the baking process in which the\\nbread is pulled from the oven after being cooked for a short time at a low\\ntemperature, just when it is going from raw dough to bread. Whatever\\nchemical composition exists in the bread in this form produces a slight\\nrelease of gas in the stomach to bring a further feeling of fullness. It is\\nnot a great deal of gas or unpleasant gas, it is just enough to create a\\nfull feeling. Other lab experts said that it could produce a pH factor in\\nthe stomach conducive to appetite satisfaction. The total scope of this\\nfactor is not totally known. There is also a trace of herbs in the bread,\\nwhich could contribute something. In all, the net effect is this: it works\\nbetter than any weight-loss product on the market, be it food or drug.\\nBefore producing the bread and marketing it, we made an all-out\\neffort to determine what laws we had to comply with. We were in a\\nnew area, and we were totally ignorant of the food business.\\nWe assumed, as anybody would, that the best place to get this\\ninformation would be the Food and Drug Administration. Therefore,\\nwe had our attorney contact the Food and Drug Administration in\\nWashington. He described what we wanted to do, the nature of the\\nproduct and asked for guidelines for the marketing and production of\\nour diet bread. Our attorney was told by the FDA that no such guide-\\nlines existed, that, in effect, this area had a big \"Fog Index,\" and you\\njust had to \"play it by ear.\"\\nI found this hard to believe, so I personally called the closest FDA\\noffice, which was in Cleveland. The phone was answered by a grumpy\\nman. After talking to him for awhile, it was obvious that he didn\\'t\\nknow much about my question. I asked him where his supervisor was,\\nand he said the FDA regional office was in Cincinnati, Ohio, and he\\ngave me a number to call there. I called the Cincinnati office, and, as\\nusual, after being shuffled around to five different people, I got the\\nsame message my attorney got. There are no guidelines for the mar-\\nketing and production of a new food product.\\nIt, therefore, appeared that we were to be off on our own. I had\\nplanned to exceed any regulations anyway because I believe in taking\\na great deal of pride in my products.

There were periods when I could eat the bread and then\\nnot eat the bread. One of the things I noticed was that I definitely felt\\nbetter during the periods I was eating the bread. In my research for writ-\\ning the ad, I thoroughly read up on the civilization of Hunza in which\\nsuch a bread is the main staple of their diet. I also read research papers\\nrelating the effects of high-fiber diets, plus several books by noted doc-\\ntors about the benefits of high-fiber diets. These studies show there are\\nmany benefits to a high-fiber diet, which include the reduction of many\\nintestinal tract diseases, reduction of obesity and the promotion of regu-\\nlarity. Some side benefits include the well-known relationship between\\nregularity and lower incidence of acne.\\nThe main thrust of the bread was as a diet aid. I usually don\\'t like\\nto complicate things in an ad. I usually stick to one main benefit. But\\nI felt these side benefits concerning nutrition were something people\\nshould know, so I decided to put them in the ad and in the brochure\\nthat accompanied the product. Now mind you, all of this information\\nis well documented and scientifically proven.\\nAfter writing the ad, we turned it over to our law firm for review.\\nThey made the usual suggestions. After that, they worried primarily\\nwhether what I said about the bread was true. They also said, since\\nwe were going into another field, the food field, this type of detailed\\nand enthusiastic advertising might not fit well there. But, who cares\\nhow it fits, as long as it\\'s 100% true. What is wrong with motivational\\nadvertising? That\\'s what built the nation.\\nWe placed the ad with several test newspapers that were scheduled\\nto run just before Christmas in 1977. Then we went about the task of\\nlining up a feasible way to get the bread produced in mass. We named\\nthe bread \"No Hunger Bread.\"\\nOriginally we attempted to come up with a way to bake the bread\\nin loaves and deliver it frozen. However, this turned out to be eco-\\nnomically impossible. The idea then hit me to sell the bread in a dry\\nmix in which the purchaser simply added water and baked the bread\\nat home. However, preparing such a dry mix turned out to have unbe-\\nlievable complications. My wife\\'s recipe called for real milk and real\\nbutter.

We were to take home and try the test loaves of the bread.\\nWe walked into their test lab of the kitchen where Mr. Palmer cut\\nslices of the bread and gave each of us one to taste. Our hearts sank. The\\ntest bread did not look, smell, feel, or taste like my wife\\'s bread. I asked\\nMr. Palmer what had gone wrong and he said he didn\\'t know. He baked it\\nexactly according to the recipe using dry milk, dry honey, and dry butter.\\nHowever, upon more discussion, we soon learned that they had taken\\nour first meeting very lightly and thought that this was ordinary whole\\nwheat bread.

For some reason I felt edgy showing the\\nColso contingent all this, but Mr. Runyan was very eager to see with\\nhis own eyes the orders coming in.\\nAfter the tour we went to the corporate house, which I purchased\\nfor such occasions. We had a caterer come in and serve dinner, giving\\nColso the royal treatment, not knowing that soon they were going to\\ngive us the royal treatment.\\nWe started out to order 200,000 pounds of mix for the first order.\\nThe meeting went on for several hours after the meal, and we ironed\\nout all the details on how everything was going to be produced and\\npackaged. The first thing that disturbed me was that Runyan did not\\nwant to get involved in the individual packages for consumers, which\\nMr. Palmer had shown an interest in. They had the facilities there to\\ndo it, and, in fact, had done it in the past, but Runyan said he wasn\\'t\\ninterested in that.

This proved to be\\nfutile. They were available, but they were too far away for us to control\\nand oversee. The problem was that we needed huge mixers because all\\nthe ingredients along with the honey had to be thoroughly blended.\\nWe also had to line up some place to package the mix we were get-\\nting from Colso into the four-pound parcels for the consumer, and it had\\nto be a place suitable for food processing. Even though the FDA said\\nthere were no such guidelines, I wanted to be sure that our customers\\'\\nbread mix would be prepared in a hygienically clean atmosphere.\\nWe searched high and low around Ohio to find such a place. The\\nvarious food-processing companies in the state that we toured were\\nappalling. There were a few that were clean and well-kept establish-\\nments, but many supposedly FDA-inspected places were filthy pigpens.\\nFinally we decided we would be just as well off to look in our home-\\ntown for a place. The most obvious choice was a hometown bakery. We\\nobtained an agreement from a local bakery specializing in pastries and\\nItalian bread called Ferraro\\'s. The owner of Ferraro\\'s agreed to lease a\\npart of his building to us for the purpose of packaging the bread.\\nHowever, this still did not solve our big problem. Where would we get\\nall of the ingredients mixed? To get it down to a feasible cost, we had\\nto have mixers that would handle 1,000 to 2,000 pounds of ingredients\\nat a time. One day when we were setting up Ferraro\\'s for the packaging\\nof the mix, an idea hit me. I saw that he had mixers there, but nothing\\non the scale that we would need. These mixers could hold about 200\\npounds, not enough for the entire job, but maybe for a portion of it.\\nMy idea was why not let the customer mix the two major ingredients\\nof honey and flour themselves, and we would simply mix the dry milk,\\nbutter, and various ingredients such as herbs. The idea was great. We\\nwould only have to mix 10% of the poundage. For instance, on a 200,000\\npound order, we would only have to mix 20,000 pounds. We could sim-\\nply include a jar of honey, pour unmixed flour into a bag, and then put\\nthe mix of minor ingredients on top of the flour and instruct the cus-\\ntomer to mix them all together. We had a trial production run, and it\\nworked beautifully. Now we had everything right in our own hometown\\nand totally under our control. Colso no longer had us over a barrel. It\\nwas my project that with the bread selling like it was, we would soon\\nbe producing finished loaves and going with national distribution to\\nretail stores.

The 200,000 pounds was supposed to be mixed February 8\\nand February 9, and we would go down to pick up shipments as soon\\nas they came off the mixing machine in order to expedite the shipping\\nprocess.

The order was finally completed on the afternoon of February\\n9, when all 200,000 pounds were at Ferraro's.

He told me it was really inconsequential and\\nthat \"there were serious problems with the advertising and labeling of\\nthe bread, so serious, in fact, that the bread could not be marketed,\\nand he doubted that it could ever be marketed again in the near future,\\nno matter what we did.\" In his opinion, our advertising and labeling\\nclassified the bread as a drug, and we had not taken out an NDA, or a\\nnew-drug application.\\nI said, \"The bread is not a drug, the bread is a food.\"\\nHe said, \"No, the things you said in reference to the fiber, etc.,\\nmade it a drug.\" He said they even classify water as a drug, if you label\\nit improperly.\\nAs we learned, if you file a new-drug application, this gives the FDA\\nthe right to: (1) delay you almost indefinitely, and (2) arbitrarily grant\\nor deny your application for a new drug, even though you may have\\nvolumes of test results to prove the validity of your product.\\nIn any case, the point was the bread was in no way a drug.

So I wrote the ad as an open\\nletter to President Carter, and it ran on February 16, 1978.\\nBefore we ran the ad, we made another last-ditch effort to settle the\\nproblem with Simmons. We had a number of these conversations with\\nno results. To this point we had not received one piece of documented\\ncorrespondence from Simmons, indicating that there was any prob-\\nlem. I was infuriated with our present law firm because its members\\nhad reviewed the ads and, although they had reservations, they cer-\\ntainly did not say categorically that anything this serious would hap-\\npen. So I fired the law firm and hired what I considered another top\\nlaw firm in Canton. It was certainly evident that dealing with food and\\ndrugs required special legal expertise and our area was not the hotbed\\nof food and drugs. FDA legal experts were concentrated in Washington\\nand New York. Through some of my New York connections, we select-\\ned a New York law firm that specialized in dealing with FDA.\\nWe hired a top lawyer with the firm, and he proceeded to research the\\ncase. One thing he did was try to find similar cases in the past. He came\\nup with an almost identical one that had occurred just the year before. It\\nconcerned International Telephone and Telegraph\\'s Continental Baking\\nCompany Division. The year before, they introduced a product called\\nFresh Horizons Bread, which contained five times the fiber of normal\\nwhole wheat bread, which was accomplished by mixing cellulose from\\nwood pulp into the bread. They had made benefit claims citing a research\\nstudy of the benefits of a high-fiber diet, the same ones that we cited.\\nHowever, they went a step further and actually distributed literature to\\ndoctors, much the same as you would a prescription drug.\\nFresh Horizons Bread was put on the market before the FDA inter-\\nvened.

But, if the FDA did feel that\\nthere was a violation of the law, then we would be more than willing\\nto cooperate.

They cited the ITT case as an example of what the FDA\\nhad done in the past. Simmons would have no part of this and was\\nnot even willing to acknowledge that the ITT case existed. He stated\\nhe had already recommended seizing our product and that the sei-\\nzure was very near. The only way that he would not seize was that if\\nwe reimbursed all of the customers and got out of the business. The\\nlawyer told Mr. Simmons it was financially impossible for us to do so,\\nthat it certainly was not fair to tell us to get out of the business. Mr.\\nSimmons repeated that the product could never be marketed again.\\nOur New York attorney said, \"Really, Mr. Simmons, you will never get\\na court of law to grant you such an injunction.\" (Simmons also told\\nus not to hire an FDA lawyer.)

Before sending the people their bread, we were willing to\\nsend them a letter that would correct the advertising he found ques-\\ntionable and would ask them if they still wanted their order.

There are three basic types\\nof seizure alerts: red alert, which means a highly toxic or poisonous\\nproduct is on the market; a green alert, something that might be mildly\\ntoxic, and thirdly, what they call an \"oh shit\" alert, which is a harmless\\nand nebulous thing like misleading advertising, particularly on labeling.\\nOurs was classified as an \"oh shit\" alert, and it was taking Simmons a\\nwhile to get the seizure cleared through Washington. We assumed he\\ngot a lot of cooperation in Washington because we had treaded on a\\nprotected territory.

This system has even been used on progressive doctors who\\ntry to experiment with something different because the standard patent\\nmedicines are not working to cure cancer. Many doctors were also hav-\\ning their reputations sabotaged, and they were put out of business.\\nThe FDA would be tipped off that a natural-health remedy was being\\nused that might become a viable market item. The FDA would make the\\nnecessary arrangements to seize the product. They would then arrange to\\nplant a story in a major news media. This occurred usually in established\\nnetwork media, such as one of the large TV networks, a key influential\\nnewspaper, or through the Associated Press. The FDA actually went so\\nfar as to have certain planted reporters actually working for them. The\\nmedia would be tipped off when a seizure would occur and coordinate\\nit with agents.

So apparently the decision was made to\\nseize without testing the product, without consumer complaints, but\\nfrom complaints from the competition.\\nI had an obligation to my customers and, whether the FDA made a\\nseizure or not, I could not sit on my orders any longer. The FTC has\\na 30-day rule that says you are supposed to ship orders after they are\\nreceived before 30 days expire. This rule was also staring us in the\\nface. I initiated the shipment of 30,000 orders. This would be a good\\ntest of whether the customers thought that they had been deceived. So\\nfar this deception idea was theoretical on the part of the FDA.\\nIn direct marketing, you can tell if you have a shoddy product or if\\nthe advertising intentionally or unintentionally misled the public. You\\ngauge this through complaints and refunds. Refunds are the best direct\\ngauge. Many government agencies claim this is not a valid measure-\\nment due to apathetic consumers. Many people who order the prod-\\nuct will not bother to send it back. But the truth is a majority of the\\npublic will send the product back if they are dissatisfied. In fact, case\\nhistories show a 90% return of a product that is either shoddy or mis-\\nleading. Acceptable refund rates by the largest, most respected mail-\\norder companies, such as large catalog houses, Time/Life books, etc.,\\nand throughout the industry range from 10% to 15%. If the product is\\na book, for some reason there is a built-in 4% refund rate. With books\\nthe public knows they can order books by mail and either photocopy\\nthe book or parts of it, or read it and then return it for a full refund.\\nSo this first 30,000 shipment would measure whether we had mis-\\nled the public or whether they were satisfied with the product. How\\ntrue was our advertising, and how good was our product? Of those\\n30,000 shipped and all succeeding shipments, there was only a one-\\nhalf of 1% refund request. Incredibly low. In fact, that kind of public\\nacceptance is usually unheard; 99 1/2% of the public was satisfied.\\nTo make matters even more convincing, we produced an ad with\\nthe help of the FDA experts in New York that deleted any reference to\\nhealth benefits.

We sent\\nhim all the information we had accumulated, which certainly provided\\ncause to believe that the FDA\\'s actions were a ploy to put us out of\\nbusiness because we were competing with vested-interest concerns.\\nThis was a direct violation of antitrust laws. Mr. Round\\'s attitude was\\nnonchalant, and I could tell immediately he was not going to do any-\\nthing. I followed up with him in succeeding months and still could tell\\nnothing was being done. I gave him leads but he never followed up. Six\\nmonths later, we got a letter saying he had done an investigation and\\ncould find no wrongdoing. No investigation ever transpired.\\nI next went to the Small Business Administration and was directed\\nto a division of the S.B.A. that was relatively new called Advocacy. It\\nwas specifically set up to protect small businesses from unjust acts\\nfrom regulatory agencies. I was turned over to an agent within this\\ndivision named Jerry Lawson. My first contact was with one of Mr.\\nLawson\\'s assistants, and he certainly was encouraging. He said, \"Keep\\nthe faith, baby. We\\'ll take care of you.\" This all sounded too good to be\\ntrue, and as it turned out, it was. After many succeeding phone calls\\nand correspondence, I learned that Advocacy was nothing but a pro-\\npaganda tool.

The most standard and obvious way is campaign contri-\\nbutions to elected officials, which is legal. There is also direct illegal pay-\\nments to elected officials called bribes. Then there are lobbyists, who\\nmust be registered to persuade elected officials how they should vote on\\ncertain issues. Those few items are only the tip of the iceberg.\\nMy investigation uncovered the meat of the system for buying\\ngovernment influence, both on the federal and state level. This under-\\nground system is where the real money changes hands. Some of it\\nlegally, but most of it illegally. Naturally, the whole thing is totally\\nconcealed from the public.\\nMost of the lobbyists in Washington and at the state level are law\\nfirms. They call themselves lobbying law firms and many times public-\\nrelations firms. These firms go beyond dealing with elected officials.\\nThere is a body in Washington considered by some to be more powerful\\nthan elected officials. This body is the congressional aides. There are,\\non the average, about 60 congressional aides for each congressman.\\nCongressmen obviously don\\'t have time to handle every detail of their\\njobs, and depending upon the congressman, he or she delegates as much\\nwork as he or she is unwilling to do. In effect, the office is run by the\\naides, with whom a citizen will deal 99% of the time.

This \"legal lobbying,\" of course, comes in the same manner\\nwith lunches and other perks.\\nThere is yet another category which is questionably legal, very\\nimmoral and unethical. This one is called buying influence through\\nthe jobs program. This is where officials of government departments,\\nespecially appointees of elected officials and also civil service workers,\\nwork in a department for awhile and give favorable treatment to a cer-\\ntain corporation. In return for this favorable treatment, he is promised\\na job with the corporation or a job with a law firm that services that\\ncorporation at a very lucrative pay.

You might be an hon-\\nest government official who would prosecute them or an honest news\\nmedia reporter doing a story on them. You have to pay your bribe\\nthrough a lobbying firm. But it even goes further than that. The lobby-\\ning law firm has to employ a personal friend of the influential govern-\\nment official for this to work. A government official is only going to\\ntake money from somebody he knows and trusts. We were told that\\nbasically what happened to us was that we started out all wrong.

These lawyers come\\nout of the make-believe world of academics, influenced by socialist\\nprofessors. Many of them just don\\'t like the fact that you are making\\nmoney. The second type of individual is looking at the government as a\\nstepping stone in his career. If he works for the government for awhile\\nand gets enough notches in his gun (which he gets by the number of\\nbusinesses he sabotages), then he is considered an effective lawyer who\\nwill most likely get a lucrative job in a law firm servicing corporations\\nin his field.\\nLarger corporations, who have already bought influence, are\\nuntouchables, and even if they weren\\'t, they have large law firms\\nand a lot of money to fight in court.

Yet, it possessed several of the qualities of a hunger-sup-\\npressant produce which the FDA allowed on the market. As for the fiber\\nclaims, it had allowed Thompson to make such claims right in the bro-\\nchure that accompanied its honey-bran pill in retail stores.\\nI contacted the FDA and demanded to know why we were being\\nselected for prosecution, and these other products were not.

After discussing the matter, we felt there was a good\\nchance that bureaucrats did not work weekends. We knew that they\\nwere monitoring our shipments at the UPS office, but the indication\\nwe got was that nobody was there on weekends. So the weekend of\\nMarch 4, 1978, we decided to try to get through with 20,000 parcels\\nof our oldest customers. Our attempt backfired in that they obviously\\nhad informants tell them of the shipment. They also must have put\\npressure on UPS to delay the shipments. For some reason the truck\\nwith these parcels did not leave over the weekend as it was supposed\\nto. It sat there until Monday morning.\\nSimmons seizure request was cleared, but for some bureau-\\ncratic reason a court order to seize could not be granted until the\\nWednesday of that week. Therefore, Simmons had the Ohio Department\\nof Agriculture come in that Monday morning and embargo our ship-\\nment. As I mentioned before, state and federal regulatory agencies\\nwork hand in hand. They are, in effect, a compromising network.\\nWe were told that Ohio laws for embargo allowed the Ohio\\nDepartment of Agriculture (ODA) to embargo goods even though they\\ndid not have a good reason. But the point was the FDA had to wait\\nuntil goods went into interstate commerce or until one was shipped\\nacross state lines in order for them to seize. The Ohio Department of\\nAgriculture does not have to meet this condition. The ODA could have\\nseized the mix at Colso's when Colso was mixing, but they did not!\\nSince the Ohio Department of Agriculture embargoed our bread, I\\nwrote a letter to our good governor, James Rhodes, who, for the last\\ndecade, has professed to be Ohio's biggest crusader to attract industry\\nand jobs to Ohio. So I wrote him a letter, and I asked him as per his cam-\\npaign promises regarding bringing industry and jobs to Ohio, would be\\nhelp our business, which we had planned to launch into a major baking\\nindustry in Ohio. Our good governor was very helpful. He sent in return\\na one-line letter, which acknowledged receipt of our letter. That was it.\\nOn March 9, 1978, the FDA was granted a seizure order.

I just want to\\nmake a point that they might have been involved. In an ensuing inves-\\ntigation, we learned in detail just what is going on and what many\\npeople call a conspiracy to suppress cancer cures.\\nIn their press releases, the FDA called our bread ordinary whole\\nwheat bread with a little fruit oil in it, which really infuriated us. The\\nbread, of course, is different because of the type of ingredients used, the\\nproportion of ingredients and the preparation. The rising time, cooking\\ntemperature and cooking time were vastly different. This was like saying\\nstainless steel was nothing more than iron wtih a little chromium in it.\\nAs far as getting our day in court, the lawyers also revealed that the\\nfederal courts are an atrocious place for a citizen to try to get a fair shake\\nwhen going up against the government. They said, in effect, that Federal\\njudges are not guardians of justice. They are political appointees who\\ncan be chosen for a variety of reasons, the least of which is competence.\\nOften they have friends who came up the political ladder with them\\nright in the U.S. Attorney\\'s office. Many of these judges were bureau-\\ncrats themselves who worked at federal agencies and were appointed\\nfor life. They don\\'t ever have to worry about retribution from the voting\\npublic. The whole system is riddled with favoritism and injustice.\\nThe public distrusts the government but views it as an invincible\\nomnipotent force. The reaction we received from the public and our\\nfriends was, \"Oh my God, what are you going to do? You\\'re dead and\\nburied. The big powerful FDA took action against you. There\\'s nothing\\nyou can do.\" Besides having regulatory agencies and the justice system\\nagainst us, phone calls came in for interviews from vulture reporters\\nhungry to pick the pieces. One was from a woman from the Washington\\nPost who was their consumer advocate. Reporters always say they are\\ngoing to do a balanced in-depth report. The public doesn\\'t know that\\n98% of the balanced in-depth reports that you see in the news media\\nwere researched with a few minutes of phone calls. They look mainly for\\nthings they can take out of context and make half-truths out of innuen-\\ndos, etc. They always look for the bad.

They did not tell me they\\nsaw anything wrong with it.\\nI looked over the ad, taking into account the bread had been seized\\nand all the items that the FDA had dictated. According to their arbi-\\ntrary decision, yes, the ad could look bad. But then I compared it to\\nads they allowed to run unmolested, and it became quite obvious this\\nwas nothing more than a case of selective prosecution to suppress\\ncompetition. Following is the No-Hunger Bread ad that precipitated\\nthe No-Hunger Bread atrocity.\\nThe point I want to make is this. As I stated earlier, we are all ped-\\ndlers of something. No group of medical-treatment peddlers has a mono-\\npoloy on the human body. The human body is far too complex for any\\none point of view or philosophy to be effective all of the time. I don\\'t\\nwant a surgeon working on me unless he is qualified, and I don\\'t want\\nto buy drugs unless they have been tested. But when they start using\\nthis power to eliminate competition and try to centralize the power in a\\ngroup of people who resemble a deity and we are to blindly believe and\\nobey them without question, then I think it has gone too far.\\nWhen you are dealing with the human body, and the incredible\\nnumber of variables that are involved, you will never find any one thing\\nthat works all the time. At most what you have are beliefs and philoso-\\nphies. Terminal diseases such as cancer cause the most unbearable\\nsuffering and the most destructive consequences both physiologically\\nand psychologically to entire families. An overwhelming majority of\\nthe population we have polled, including myself, feel that they do not\\nwant a disease that represents such a challenge in degree and difficulty\\nto cure to be left to one point of view or in the hands of a certain small\\nclique of power-hungry egomaniacs.\\nIn researching this matter, we have found articles that report that\\ncertain scientists were willing to shoot anybody who came up with a\\ncure for cancer before they did and said the person who comes up with\\na cancer cure had better go hide in the farthest corner of the earth. Just\\nwhat the hell is going on here and what is this world coming to with this\\nkind of attitude? This phenomenon repeats itself over and over again\\nin research centers across the country, as I experienced working for a\\nresearch center of a major corporation. Pure jealousy reigns supreme.\\nAfter the seizure a surprising thing happened.

Spokesman\\nWayne Pines said that Coca-Cola\\'s ads were deceptive and that they\\ngrossly misrepresent the product and fail to point out many harmful\\nside effects. The charges state that Coca-Cola is nothing more than\\na sugared, carbonated soft drink that extracts from the cola nut for\\nflavor. The caffeine from the cola nut is a drug that alters body chem-\\nistry and can be dangerous in many situations, especially to preg-\\nnant women and to heart patients, as it constricts arteries.

It contains caffeine, which constricts the arteries and could\\nbe dangerous to certain individuals. The sugar and carbonation also\\npromote tooth decay. The soft drink does not quench thirst, because\\nthe sugar content causes more absorption of water, and, in fact has the\\ntendancy to make one thirstier. However, Coca-Cola does taste good. So,\\nif you wish to purchase it for that purpose only, we will sell it to you.\\nThis fictitious situation depicts the absurdity of that section of\\nadvertising law which says, \"The dumbest person in the world can-\\nnot misunderstand.\" A bureaucrat can arbitrarily say that you implied\\nthings, depending upon his imagination. We monitored countless other\\nweight-loss product ads, and we could have built a case against any\\nof them. One product, Figurines, produced by Pillsbury, has a slender\\nwoman singing and eating a Figurine and saying that she got sweet\\nrevenge on dieting. We had over 35 people review the ad and all 35 said\\nthey interpreted the ad to mean that Figurines were a sweet tasting, spe-\\ncially developed candy-like substance that had the ability to suppress\\nappetite, or possibly they had some other mysterious eleent that caused\\none to lose weight. These people got the impression that Figurines had\\nthese qualities, yet was still lower in calories than most food. They were\\ntotally misled. Would you believe Figurines contain over 150 calories\\nper ounce? Higher, or as high, as most candy bars. What they really are\\nis a candy bar with nutritional supplements of vitamins. You could get\\nthe same by taking vitamin pills and eating a candy bar.\\nWe reviewed similar ads for \"diet aids,\" which were nothing more\\nthan vitamin pills and protein supplements. But the ads are designed to\\nimply that you could eat all the food you wanted. The ad showed women\\ncarrying trays of food through the kitchen for a midafternoon get-togeth-\\ner, implying that with this aid you could eat all the food you wanted.\\nThe FDA was putting pressure on us to get us to belly up. The word\\ncame back from informants, no more ads. In fact, this was a common\\ncry among many different informants, who were totally unrelated. No\\nmore ads. Play the game. Don\\'t\\' make waves. Get out of the diet busi-\\nness, but you can continue in other forms of business.\\nAlso, during this time, the FDA was doing other things to try to ter-\\nrorize us.

Lawyers have a legiti-\\nmate concern for their clients, but it\\'s also hard for them to fully dis-\\nlike the federal bureaucracy in light of the fact that it creates so much\\nwork for the legal profession. Considering what seemed to be the\\nfutileness of our position, they began rationalizing what the FDA had\\ndone. They started calling some members of the U.S. Attorney\\'s office\\nwho work for the FDA, overworked and underpaid civil servants who\\nwere probably mad that they made $15,000 per year, and I was making\\na lot of money. With regard to selective prosecution, they said, using\\nan analogy, \"You can\\'t stop everybody. If the speed limit is 55 mph\\nand you are going 56, he has a right to cite you.

This was obviously what they allowed others to do in the\\npast, specifically, to change their advertising or at the very least to\\nmail corrective advertising along with the fulfillment packages, giving\\nthe customer a chance for a refund.\\n\"If they felt they had to press charges, I would expect that they\\nwould have to file suit like anybody else and prove their case in court\\nbefore a jury of my peers in a fair trial.\\n\"But that\\'s not what happened.

The federal bureaucracy, with its socialistic nature and\\ntotalitarian approach, is not truly American. They are aliens. I think it\\nis our job as citizens to expose them and get rid of them. Not to sound\\nhokey, but look at it this way. All the soldiers in all the wars the United\\nStates has been engaged in, for the most part, believed that they were\\nfighting for freedom. Granted, many times they were misled, but they\\nstill thought they were. Many men fought and died to supposedly stop\\ncommunism from taking over from the outside. To let communism\\ntake over from within would mean that they all died for nothing. I\\nthink it\\'s time to realize that there are people in our government who\\nwant to take away our freedom and enslave us. Even though you don\\'t\\nlike the task as citizens, it is your duty to defeat, or at least stand up\\nto, those totalitarian entities when they engage in an offensive against\\nyou.\\nWith much more deliberation, a final counteroffensive strategy was\\nlaunched. It would consist of: (1) publicity, which we are very good at,\\nmuch better than the bureaucrats; (2) an all-out extensive and detailed\\ninvestigation to determine exactly what happened, who was involved,\\nand the nature and extent of the conspiracy, if there was one; and, (3)\\nwe would publicize the information we obtained. We would push for\\nlegislation to correct the matter even though this is a very long-term\\nitem. We would pressure the bureaucracy from within. We would dog\\nand harass those bureaucrats involved for 20 years, if necessary, and\\ncampaign for their dismissal. We would create a defense prosecution\\nlegislation trust, for which we would solicit other businessmen with\\nthe concept that this was a landmark case. If we could prosecute these\\nbureaucrats by suing them individually, winning would be a staggering\\ndefeat for this tyranny.

We held our meeting in one of the interrogation rooms,\\nas branch offices of the FBI are fairly small. It appeared this one con-\\nsisted of at most two to three offices. We engaged in preliminary small\\ntalk with the agent. It was quite evident that he was into their TV\\nimage.

The phony consumerism movement, which started in the\\nearly \\'60s, had everybody conditioned that this was truly the worst\\nsin you could commit, mainly because it was the one most prosecuted\\nby the \"consumer protection system.\" Why? Because it is the easiest\\nto prosecute. The advertising laws are nebulous and with documented\\nadvertising you have your proof before you in black and white. But is\\nit the worst sin? There are others that are much worse, but are bought\\nand paid for and much more difficult to prosecute.

I will list them in order by the estimated extent to\\nwhich they take money right out of the consumer\\'s pocket.\\nPrice-fixing and monopolies. Contrary to popular belief, govern-\\nment spending is not the number one cause of inflation. Price-fixing\\nis.

These critical\\ncommodities then force up all other prices.\\nCompetition, as everyone knows, is the number one element need-\\ned for the production of high-quality products at reasonable prices.\\nWhen you eliminate competition, you immediately have the reverse,\\nshoddy products and runaway inflation.\\nBribery. Bribery is used when a purchasing agent, key officer of a\\ncorporation or government official takes a bribe to pay a higher price\\nfor a product or service instead of picking products or services on the\\nbasis of the lowest bid and highest quality. This also contributes to\\ninflation and shoddy products. As everyone knows, one of the biggest\\nmarkets for bribery is among government officials.\\nMisleading verbal sales pitches.

To go even further, they would have you believe\\nthat the worst culprits of all are people in direct-mail or mail-order as\\nthey call it.

What stands out in this case is the selectiveness\\nof prosecution, the inequitable treatment relative to similar cases, the\\npunishment which did not fit the violation, the deliberate denial of due\\nprocess of law, and lastly, the overtones of the underlying motivation of\\nthe regulatory network with regard to suppression of competition.\\nWe were soon to get many more examples of just how selectively\\nthe regulatory network does prosecute. It was surfacing more and\\nmore how important this issue was and why it is mandatory today\\nthat a law should be drafted against this unethical practice. Selective\\nprosecution shakes the very foundation of the law and order.\\nIf the FDA came down on every corporation or individual equally in\\nsimilar instances, I would say, \"Well, they are hard-nosed about it, but at\\nleast they are fair, and that\\'s the law, and I\\'ll adapt accordingly.

But at that time it was one of the most tyrannical and unconsti-\\ntutional government agencies that existed.

The\\nUSPS Postal Inspection Service and the Law Department have cer-\\ntain products categorized as \"red flags\" which, from our observation\\nbased on a pattern of facts, exist for no other purpose than to restrict\\ncompetition to favored special interests (type 4 prosecution).

Also in these unwarranted\\naction cases, the promotion for these products contains nothing false,\\neither by inclusion or by omission. Therefore, the USPS has to invent a\\ncharge. Since there is nothing false in the promotion, the USPS will say\\n\"it is misleading.\" The USPS knows full well that 20%-30% of people are\\nconfused by any type of communication, be it a book, movie, newscast\\nor advertisement. Studies have shown this conclusively. Such a charge\\ncould be made about any effective advertisement.\\nSuch a trumped-up charge sometimes initially looks like it may have\\nsubstance, but it is unlikely the case could be won in front of an impar-\\ntial judge or jury. The USPS knows it does not have to worry about that.\\nIt will file the charge under the civil statutes which guarantee it a mock\\njustice system, which is 100% in its favor. The USPS won\\'t have to worry\\nabout impartial judges or juries of the defendant\\'s peers.\\nAgain, the USPS\\'s intent many times is not to work in the public\\ninterest. The intent is to put a product or service that competes with\\nthe favored special interest off the market, or to reach its quotas, or to\\npunish a company for exercising freedom of speech, or to gain public-\\nity for the USPS.\\nSTEP 4 â A threatening correspondence is mailed to the target\\ncompany\\'s chief operating officer or statutory agent, which outlines\\nthe intended prosecution by the USPS and demands that the company\\nsign a \"consent decree,\" which will put the product off the market and\\nlikely the company out of business. These consent decrees, sometimes\\ncalled consent decree judgments, are just that â judgments that are\\nagreed to by the target company and have the same force of law as\\nthough a judgment were made in the court. The only difference is that\\nthe defendant does not admit any guilt but does agree to cease and\\ndesist doing whatever it is to which the USPS objects.\\nSTEP 5 â A USPS law enforcement official, usually a postal inspec-\\ntor, many times accompanied by a law department official, will call for a\\nmeeting with the target company\\'s chief executive or attorneys. In this\\nmeeting, a signing of the consent decree is demanded along with volun-\\ntarily allowing the USPS to hold all orders for the product that are still\\nleft to come in. Many times the USPS will also demand a refunding of\\nmoney to the people that have already ordered the product.

It does not have to prove that anyone was\\nactually deceived. It only has to show \"probable cause\" that the pro-\\nmotion for the product theoretically MAY be deceptive or the product\\ntheoretically MAY be injurious. Also, the target company\\'s attorneys\\nare at a great disadvantage at the TRO hearing, because they only get\\na few days, at the most, in which to prepare while the USPS has been\\npreparing its case for weeks.\\nVirtually no one has ever won a TRO or preliminary injunction case\\nwith the USPS because the statute and case law governing this proceed-\\ning is blatantly unjust and in favor of the USPS, and federal judges are\\nblatantly biased in favor of the USPS. The USPS wins virtually 100%\\nof the time. (There appears to be only one exceptional case where the\\nUSPS lost a preliminary injunction case in a Wisconsin federal court.)\\nIn these proceedings, the federal judge is openly biased in favor\\nof the USPS. Attorneys say that the judge has no choice in the case\\nbecause of the statutes and previous case law. But if such were the case,\\ncomputers could decide these cases, not judges. In the cases we have\\nwitnessed, the postal service had presented no compelling proof whatso-\\never of their charges in order to get TROs and preliminary injunctions.\\nBut the federal judges will make their decision as follows.

Here is a brief summary of one of these complaints involv-\\ning Mr. Simmons.\\nIn 1978 one company tried to market a very good diet bread but\\nwere neophytes in marketing food products. They asked for rules and\\nguidelines from Mr. Simmons office, but none were provided. After\\nthey started marketing the bread and were receiving tens of thousands\\nof orders, Mr. Simmons sent two agents to their office under the false\\npretenses of \"routine checks.\" The company specifically asked these\\nagents if anything was wrong, and if there was, they would be glad\\nto be cooperative. But all during their encounter, which took several\\nweeks, Mr. Simmons\\' agents repeatedly said that nothing was wrong\\nand all they were doing was a routine check.\\nAll the while Mr. Simmons\\' Agents were gathering information\\nthat would allow the FDA to seize the inventory of the diet bread. Mr.\\nSimmons\\' intentions, which he deliberately did not disclose, were to\\nseize as much of the diet bread as possible to put the company out of\\nbusiness.\\nThe seizure by the FDA was then carried out. During the seizure,\\nMr. Simmons coordinated television coverage to humiliate and assas-\\nsinate the character of the executives of the company. We know at\\nthis time, that Mr. Simmons did not have any consumer complaints,\\nand therefore, we suspect he had complaints from competitors in the\\nsynthetic drug business because this diet bread was selling well and\\nposed a competitive threat to a new synthetic patent diet pill which\\nwas introduced to the market at the same time.\\nBut even worse, after the diet bread was seized, which amounted to\\n20,000 4-lb. cartons, (80,000 pounds, of mix, enough to make 112,000\\npounds of bread by adding water, enough to feed 1,200,000 people)\\nthe company offered to take on the expense of distributing the seized', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Inadvertently, one of the ingredients suppliers of a minor\\ningredient had put a preservative in that ingredient. But this preserva-\\ntive in the entire bread mix would have amounted to an ineffectual\\ntrace. The bread was perfectly good and harmless.\\nMr. Simmons saw to it that the bread was destroyed and plowed\\nunder in a landfill in Euclid, Ohio. To make matters even worse, he\\nhad one of his agents go up to the Euclid landfill and take pictures of\\nthe bread being plowed under. The only reason we could see that Mr.\\nSimmons would want such pictures would be so that he could gloat\\nover such a matter, which certainly has to reflect a cruel and malicious\\nnature.\\nWe do not feel Mr. Simmons acted in the interest of the public or\\nacted as a fit government administrator for the following reasons. The\\nseizure of this diet bread was totally unnecessary and unwarranted. If\\nMr. Simmons was only trying to gain compliance with FDA regulations,\\nand really did not have a malicious intent, he would have simply made\\nit known at the beginning to the company that the label and marketing\\nof the bread did not meet his approval. The company, from the start,\\ndemonstrated that they wanted to comply with regulations and would\\nbe cooperative in doing so. If Mr. Simmons had made his intentions\\nknown earlier, the company would have not produced and packaged\\na large amount of the bread under the labeling that did not meet Mr.\\nSimmons\\' approval and would have made changes to the advertising.\\nThe changes could have been made early and thus inexpensively to\\nmeet with the approval of Mr. Simmons.\\nSecondly, after a large amount of the bread had been packaged, it is\\nwell documented that in other such cases large companies were allowed\\nto sell out mislabeled packages and correct the labeling when new pack-\\nages were printed.\\nLastly, there was certainly no reason beyond the stretch of anyone\\'s\\nimagination why Mr. Simmons would not allow enough bread to feed\\nover 1.2 million people to be provided to the hungry people in Ohio\\nrather than needlessly destroying it.\\nWe do not feel that this is the way a good government official should\\nbehave.

Eikenberry held large, seeming insurmountable leads\\nover all other candidates. He had been re-elected as attorney general\\nthree times by wide margins, had previously held political office in the\\nstate legislature, and had headed the Washington State Republican\\nparty in the \\'70s. He was the only candidate with statewide name rec-\\nognition.\\nFive years before his gubernatorial run, Eikenberry siphoned over\\n$100 million of public money into the attorney general\\'s office, so he\\ncould institute lawsuits that would bolster his career â even though\\nthey were not in the public interest. This was ostensibly done to fur-\\nther his campaign for governor. He increased spending at five times the\\nrate of inflation. It appears that he hired over three times the number\\nof personnel needed in an attorney general\\'s office for a state that size\\nin order to build an in-house campaign team. His overall budget of $52\\nmillion per year was over two and a half times that of attorneys general\\nbudgets for similarly sized states.\\nIn order to get free publicity, Eikenberry filed hundreds of apparently\\nbaseless civil lawsuits against Washington State businesses and compa-\\nnies across the nation, including Proctor and Gamble here in Ohio.\\nBut in late 1991, the bully finally picked on the wrong guy.\\nEikenberry filed a false and frivolous lawsuit against our Lindenwold\\nFine Jewelers division, a national jewelry retailer of both fine jewelry\\nand high-quality synthetic gem jewelry.

Weisbaum did run a\\npreliminary story in December, 1991, which contained certain falsities\\nin order to preview the \"big story.\" This report got national coverage on\\nthe \"CBS This Morning\" show.\\nHowever, unknown to Eikenberry, Lindenwold was only one of\\n13 divisions of The Suarez Corporation, now Suarez Corporation\\nIndustries. He did not know we were a widely diversified marketing\\nand communications company. Unfortunately for Eikenberry, one of\\nthe other divisions was Campaign Services, one of the best and most\\nadvanced political service bureaus in the nation. Also unknown to\\nEikenberry was the fact the owner and president of Suarez Corporation\\nIndustries, yours truly, is highly regarding as one of the leading market-\\ning experts in the nation.\\nAn investigation of Eikenberry by Suarez Corporation Industries\\nrevealed his pattern of self-serving and special-interest-serving actions.\\nIt was determined by Suarez Corporation Industries investigators that\\nEikenberry was perhaps one of the worst and most destructive politi-\\ncians in the country.

At this point, we decided that it was in the public interest\\nto take action to defeat Eikenberry on behalf of businesses across the\\nnation and the 100,000 customers the company had in Washington.\\nA well-designed political strategy was developed in early 1992, uti-\\nlizing the company\\'s high-tech political expertise. The strategy called\\nfor crippling Eikenberry\\'s fund-raising campaign with an initial attack\\nin May, 1992, and then finishing him off in the Republican primary\\nwith a second attack, just before the elections in the fall of 1992.

As part of the proceedings, Eikenberry\\nobtained over 100,000 names and addresses of Lindenwold custom-\\ners in the State of Washington, and mailed a letter to many, perhaps\\nall, of these customers denouncing Lindenwold and telling the cus-\\ntomers that he was going to stop Lindenwold from doing business in\\nWashington. The letter backfired.\\nEikenberry found that Lindenwold\\'s customers were highly satisfied\\nand that the company was offering them the highest-quality jewelry at\\nthe best prices in the nation. Eikenberry\\'s letter resulted in a barrage of\\nangry responses from Lindenwold customers, rebuking Eikenberry for\\nhis unwanted interference and unjust attack on a reputable company.\\nMost customers were angered because they were looking forward to\\ndoing much of their Christmas shopping from Lindenwold\\'s catalog,\\nand Eikenberry\\'s actions threatened a major inconvenience. This letter\\ncost Eikenberry an additional substantial number of votes.\\nOn November 3, 1992, Eikenberry was defeated in the general elec-\\ntion by Mike Lowry, a candidate who had never held a state office, by\\n53% to 47%.\\nBut the problems were not yet over for Weisbaum and CBS. Suarez\\nCorporation Industries filed a lawsuit against Weisbaum and CBS for\\nbroadcasting a malicious reckless and false story that defamed us. The\\nlawsuit sought $25 million in damages.\\nAgain, counter-offensive tactics are not going to help you if you have\\ndone something truly wrong.

You need to know that the gov-\\nernment is not going to take care of you. Your friends are not going to\\ntake care of you. Your family does not have the responsibility to take\\ncare of you. Your boss does not have the responsibility to take care of\\nyou. Society is not going to take care of you. No one is coming to the\\nrescue.\\nIf you want to live a happy, successful life the number one most\\nimportant thing you could ever do is to take personal responsibility for\\neverything that happens in your life. You cannot have victim mentality.\\nYou can\\'t have \"oh, poor me\" mentality. You can\\'t have \"everything bad\\nhappens to me\" mentality. You need to take charge of your life. You need\\nto be the leader in your own life first. You need to take 100 percent per-\\nsonal responsibility. When you do, you will see absolutely miraculous\\nchanges in your life. I am in the process of writing a book called The\\nFive-Minute Miracle. In this book I talk about how in just five minutes a\\nperson\\'s life can completely change if they simply take personal respon-\\nsibility.

They want to believe that they are not the cause of what is hap-\\npening in their life. This is untrue. You are the \"cause\" of everything\\nthat happens in your life. Most people live a life totally at the \"affect\"\\nof everything that goes on around them. Most people live a life like a\\nship on the high seas without a rudder and without an engine, simply\\ngoing wherever the wind blows and wherever the tide takes them.\\nMost people live a life believing they have no control over what hap-\\npens in their life; that all the situations around them are in control\\nof their life. This is not true. You are 100 percent in control of your\\nlife and your destiny. When you wake up and apply \"The Five-Minute\\nMiracle,\" which is taking personal responsibility, everything in your\\nlife changes for the better!\\nIn relation to health, the first thing you must do is take responsibil-\\nity for finding natural cures for your disease. It is your responsibility to\\nfind the CAUSE of your disease. It is your responsibility to investigate\\nand seek out the answers. It is your responsibility to find the solutions.\\nMany people see miraculous cures in their health when they simply\\nwake up one morning and make the decision that they are going to beat\\ntheir disease, and they are going to find the cause and the cure. I\\'ve\\nseen people simply make that decision and within days their disease\\nis cured. It seems miraculous, but the fact is once they made up their\\nmind, once they made the DECISION that they were going to beat the\\ndisease, their own mind and belief cured the disease!\\nI believe the first, most important thing you can do is take per-\\nsonal responsibility and make the decision that you are going to\\nfind the cause and cure for your disease. In order to do this, in my\\nopinion, the first thing you must do is seek out licensed health-care\\npractitioners to help you achieve this goal. I believe it is vital that you\\nget treated by licensed health-care practitioners and do not attempt\\nto treat yourself. I, myself, know huge amounts of information when it\\ncomes to the cause and curing of illness and disease. I believe I know a\\nlot about preventing disease. However, I still go and seek the advice and\\nopinions of licensed health-care practitioners on a REGULAR BASIS!

First, studies were through two cor -\\nrespondence courses, by Dr. Vasant Lad and Dr. \\nDavid Frawley. They were the first authors in the \\nU.S. to present Ãyurveda in a simple, thorough, \\nand clear manner. Conversations with Dr. Frawley \\nshowed him to have a generous spirit  of one who \\nis a living example of  Ãyurveda.\\n \\nNext, I went to India to get a deeper understand -\\ning and experience from the source. My teachers \\nwere Dr. R. H. Singh, department head of Kaya -\\nchikits a, at Benares Hindu University (BHU) and \\nDr. I. P. Singh, professor of Ãyurveda at BHU, \\nwho generously shared some of their time to per -\\nsonally tutor and allow me to tour the BHU Ãy -\\nurveda clinic with their students. Dr. I.P.  Singh \\nspent many days privately tutoring me on herbol -\\nogy and the spiritual foundations of the subject. \\nBHU is among the most respected Ãyurvedic \\nuniversities in India, and it was a great blessing \\nto have such esteemed teachers share their time, knowledge, and experience.\\n \\nDuring my spiritual studies with my Guruji \\nin the Himalayan town of UttarkaÃ¤hi , I met Dr. \\nRam Chandra Uniyal, with whom I have studied \\nfor many years. He kindly allowed me to sit in \\non his consultations and gain greater practical \\nexperience of pulse analysis and treatment of \\ndisease. Dr. Uniyal, a recognized expert on Hi -\\nmalayan mountain herbs, took the  photographs \\nof the herbs in this book and reviewed the book \\nfor technical accuracy. Without his input on the \\nherbal therapies in Section 4, it would have been impossible to complete this work.\\n \\nAnother peer review member, Dr. Satnam S. \\nSandhu, provided several insights on the tradition \\nof Ãyurveda, as well as some reflections in the \\nrealm of Western medicine. His assistance, tech -\\nnical and otherwise, has been crucial to the accu -\\nracy and authenticity of this book.The third peer review member was Dr. J. Kishan \\nChandhok who has gone through many chapters \\nwith a fine tooth comb, helping to clarify many important points.\\n \\nThe author of the poem, A Psalm of Dedica -\\ntion (page ix), is Swami Suddev Tirtha, my elder \\nguru brother, was an extremely learned man, yet \\nsimple and humble (even at age 92 he was the \\nâstand-byâ swami to replace the Shankaracharya \\n[highest spiritual post in India] should his pres -\\ncence be required). I am honored to accept and \\nprint his wonderful poem about the universality \\nof religion. The underlying theme of this book is \\nthe universality of Ãyurveda as a healing science \\nand how it integrates simply with all other forms \\nof healing, including modern medicine. Swamiji \\nexpired several months before the publication of this book, and is dearly remembered.\\n \\nDr. Anil Kumar Darji also deserves recognition \\nfor providing some modern explanations for Ãy -\\nurvedic pathologies, as well as some of the herbal \\nenergetics in the materia medica. Over the years \\nhe has taugh me how to address many of the more \\nserious health disorders. For example we suc -\\ncessfully treated non-Hodgkins lymphoma along \\nwith western drugs - healing a condition that has \\na 50% survival rate. It is this deep level of Ãy -\\nurvedic healing that I hope can be introduced in the West.\\n \\nCountless thanks are also due to Guru Am -\\nrit Kaur Khalsa who took great care editing this \\nbook. She worked above and beyond the call of \\nduty, taking a personal interest in this project.\\nIn this 2nd edition Gary Matson illustrated the \\nyoga poses, providing greater clarity and a greater \\nsense of joy.\\nFinally, I am most grateful to my Guruji, His \\nHoliness 1008 Sri Sri Srimat Swami Narayan \\nTirthaji Maharaj, without whose blessings and \\ngrace this task could never have been achieved.\\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To \\nthat end I have endeavored to provide the follow -\\ning: deeper insight into the spiritual foundation of \\nÃyurveda; the cause,  unfoldment, and healing of \\ndiseases; photographs of Ãyurvedic herbs; a more \\ncomprehensive materia medica; diacritical marks \\nto facilitate pronunciation of Sanskrit (Ãyurvedic \\nlanguage) words; an expanded presentation of \\nÃyurvedic haÃ³ha yoga and prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma with pho -\\ntographs; an expanded paÃ±cha karma chapter; \\na discussion of current research on many of the \\nÃyurvedic herbs; a discussion of the complimen -\\ntary relationship between Western and Ãyurvedic \\nmethods; and discussions based not only on tradi -\\ntional Ãyurvedic thought, but also on the practi -\\ncal results of my experiences and those of other \\nÃyurvedic doctors and practitioners. \\nTo achieve these ends, the ancient Ãyurvedic \\ntexts were consulted along with books by contem -\\nporary authors. The purpose was to synthesize an -\\ncient tradition with modern use. Authentic Vedic  \\nspiritual books have also been researched to better \\nincorporate the spiritual dimension of Ãyurveda.\\nAn attempt has been made to present the mate -\\nrial in a simple and instructive manner, accessible \\neven to those with little prior knowledge of Ãy -\\nurveda. It is also hoped it will help unite Western \\nand Ãyurvedic traditions.\\nThis book is composed of four sections:\\n1. Ãyurvedic Theory/Fundamentals\\n2. Constitution (DoÃha) and Illness Diagnosis\\n3. Therapeutic Modalities\\n4. Specific Illnesses and Diseases (Diagnosis,\\npathology, and therapies)\\nAs a living wisdom, Ãyurvedaâs focus always \\nchanges with the times. Much has changed since 1998. Back then, people were new to Ãyurveda \\nand were interested and impressed by its medical \\nhealing abilities. Over the past 18 years, people \\nwho have been healed by Ãyurvedic medicines, \\nnow want some greater connection to life, nature, \\nfamily, community, and spirit. So with this sec -\\nond edition, there is a greater focus on the more \\nspiritual and holistic realms of Ãyurveda that are \\nexpressed in the original Vedas. Iâve also included \\nmore Ãyurvedic parallels with Western medicine, \\nand research to keep current with modern views.\\nMany people tell me their illness is a spiritual \\nteacher, and to just heal using herbs without ad -\\ndressing the lesson to learn puts herbs into a simi -\\nlar boat as Western drugs; it does an injustice to \\nthe value of illness. Certainly they like to address \\nthe illness, but they are now asking to consider it \\nin its greater life context. \\nÃyurveda guides a person to unfold their spiri -\\ntual, whole-life vision by addressing personal, \\nsocial, environmental, educational, political, and \\nspiritual areas of life. Each person can add some -\\nthing uniquely blessed to the world. \\nBy focusing on positive emotions, and creating \\nmore enlightened ways of helping the people and \\nplanet,  the people in society can utilize Ãyurve -\\ndaâs natural tools to create a modern day Garden \\nof Eden on earth.\\nThe essence of Ãyurvedaâs teachings is that, \\nwithin us, we each have an inexhaustable well of \\ncreativity, energy, and wealth that can be used to \\ncreate any and all devotional, miraculous things \\nto help make this a better world for all.\\nAs with all areas of life, dear readers, you will \\nsucceed by using your common sense, practical -\\nity, intuition, and highest inner vision.\\nBayville, NY , USA\\nAugust, 2007Introduction  \\nThe knowledge of Ãyurveda was handed down from BrahmÃ¡ to DakÃha PrajÃ¡pati, onto the\\nAÃhwin twins (the divine doctors), then passed to Indra.

It is believed to be the oldest healing science \\nin existence, forming the foundation of all others. \\nBuddhism, Taoism, Tibetan, and other cultural \\nmedicines have many similar parallels to Ãyurve -\\nda. The secret of Ãyurvedaâs individualized heal -\\ning method was preserved in India, whereas it has \\nbeen lost or superseded in other cultures. \\nThe First World Medicine\\nÃyurveda (pronounced Aa-yer-vay-da), said to \\nbe a world medicine, is the most holistic or com -\\nprehensive medical system available. Before the \\narrival of writing, the ancient wisdom of healing, \\nprevention, and longevity was a part of the spiri -\\ntual tradition of a universal religion.  Healers gath -\\nered from the world over, bringing their medical \\nknowledge to India. Veda Vyasa , the famous sage, \\npreserved the complete knowledge of Ãyurveda \\nin writing, along with the more spiritual insights \\nof ethics, virtue, and Self-Realization. Others say \\nÃyurveda was passed down from God to his an -\\ngels, and finally to humans.\\nThe methods used to find this knowledge of \\nherbs, foods, aromas, gems, colors, yoga , man-\\ntras, lifestyle, and surgery are fascinating and \\nvaried. The sage, physicians/surgeons of the time \\nwere the same sages or seers, deeply devoted holy \\npeople, who saw health as an integral part of spiri -\\ntual life. It is said that they received their train -\\ning of Ãyurveda through direct cognition during \\nmeditation. That is, the knowledge of the use of \\nthe various methods of healing, prevention, lon -gevity, and surgery came through Divine revela -\\ntion; guessing or animal testing was unnecessary. \\nThese revelations were transcribed from oral tra -\\ndition into written form, interspersed with aspects \\nof mortal life and spirituality.\\nOriginally four main books of Vedic spiritual -\\nity existed. Topics included health, ecology, as -\\ntrology, spiritual business, government, military, \\npoetry, and ethical living. In short, life was sa -\\ncred, holistic, integrated and interdependent. The \\nseparation into parts of life, as we know it today, \\nwere not considered natural. These books are \\nknown as the Vedas : Â¼ik, Sama, Yajur, and Athar -\\nva. Ãyurveda was used along with Vedic astrol -\\nogy (called JyotiÃh , that is, oneâs âinner lightâ). \\nÃyurveda is said to have its main origins in the \\nAtharva Veda. This upaveda/ branch dealt with the \\nhealing aspects of spirituality and life as a whole; \\nit praises ecology (earth, sun, moon, water, etc.), \\nadvised on political, social, economic, health, and \\nall other areas of life. In short, it shows how to re -\\nmain within oneâs spirit and live in harmony with \\nnature. Among the Â¼ik Vedaâs 10,572 hymns are \\ndiscussions of the three constitutions ( doÃhas) : \\nair (VÃ¡yu), fire (Pitta), and water (Kapha). Topics \\ncomprised organ transplants, artificial limbs, and \\nthe use of herbs to heal diseases of the mind and \\nbody and to foster longevity. Within the Atharva \\nVeda âs 5,977 hymns are discussions of anatomy, \\nphysiology, and surgery. \\nAround the 8th century B.C.E., knowledge of \\nthe medical aspect of this holistic, spiritual whole \\n-life wisdom reportedly fell into misunderstand -\\ning.

Through research \\nand testing, they dispelled the doubts of the more \\npractical and scientific minded, removing the aura \\nof mystery that surrounded Divine revelation. \\nConsequently, Ãyurveda grew in respect and be -\\ncame a widely used system of healing in India. \\nIt is said that while the Vedas are eternal wis -\\ndom, they adapt to the needs of the time. So it \\nwas that this spiritual, wholistic wisdom, came to \\nemphasize the mind and body. However, through -\\nout the teachings, it was clearly noted that the first \\ncause of illness is loss of faith in spirituality.\\nPeople from many countries came to Indian \\nÃyurvedic schools to learn about this medicine \\nin its entirety. Chinese, Tibetans, Greeks, Ro -\\nmans, Egyptians, Afghanis, Persians, and others \\ntraveled to absorb the wisdom and bring it back \\nto their own countries. Indiaâs Silk Road, an es -\\ntablished trade route between Asia (China, Tibet, \\netc.), the Middle East (Afghanistan, Persia, etc.), \\nand Europe (Rome, Greece, etc.), provided a link \\nbetween cultures.

The third \\nmajor treatise is called the AÃhÃ¾Ã¡Ã±ga H^idayam , \\na concise version of the works of Charak and \\nSuÃhruta .

These books are believed to \\nbe over 1,200 years old and contain the original \\nand complete knowledge of this Ãyurvedic world \\nmedicine. Consequently, Ãyurveda is the only \\ncomplete ancient medical system in existence.\\nCharak represents the Ãtreya school of physi -\\ncians, discussing physiology, anatomy, etiology, \\npathogenesis, symptoms and signs of disease, \\nmethodology of diagnosis, treatment and pre -scription for patients, prevention, and longevity. \\nInternal and external causes of illness are also \\nconsidered. Charak maintains that the first cause \\nof illness is the loss of faith in the Divine. In other \\nwords, when people do not recognize that God \\ndwells within all things, including themselves, \\nthis separation of vision creates a gap. This gap \\ncauses a longing or suffering for oneness of vi -\\nsion. This suffering then manifests itself as the be -\\nginning of spiritual, mental, and physical disease. \\nExternal influences on health include time of day, \\nthe seasons, diet, and lifestyle. An entire section \\nis devoted to discussions of the medicinal aspects \\nof herbs, diet, and reversal of aging.\\nSuÃhruta comes from the Dhanvantari school \\nof surgeons. In America, a society of surgeons \\nnamed themselves the SuÃhruta Society in re -\\nmembrance of the Ãyurvedic father of surgery. \\nThis text presents sophisticated accounts of surgi -\\ncal equipment, classification of abscesses, burns, \\nfractures, and wounds, amputation, plastic sur -\\ngery, and anal/rectal surgery.

Although finding \\nthe cause of an illness is still a mystery to modern \\nscience, it was the main goal of Ãyurveda. Six \\nstages of the development of disease were known, \\nincluding aggravation, accumulation, overflow, \\nrelocation, a buildup in a new site, and manifesta -\\ntion into a recognizable disease. Modern equip -\\nment and diagnosis can only detect a disease dur -\\ning the fifth and sixth stages of illness. Ãyurvedic \\nphysicians can recognize an illness in the making \\nbefore it creates more serious imbalance in the \\nbody. Health is seen as a balance of the biological \\nhumors, whereas disease is an imbalance of the \\nhumors. Ãyurveda creates balance by supplying \\ndeficient humors and reducing the excess ones. \\nSurgery is seen as a last resort. Modern medicine \\nis just beginning to realize the need to supply \\nrather than to remove, but still does not know how \\nor what to supply.\\nAdditionally, there are over 2,000 medicinal \\nplants classified in Indiaâs materia medica. A \\nunique therapy, known as paÃ±cha karma (five ac -\\ntions), completely removes toxins from the body. \\nThis method reverses the disease path from its \\nmanifestation stage, back into the blood stream, \\nand eventually into the gastrointestinal tract (the \\noriginal site of the disease). It is achieved through \\nspecial diets, oil massage, and steam therapy. At \\nthe completion of these therapies, special forms \\nof emesis, purgation, and enema remove excesses \\nfrom their sites of origin.

This is a valid question, which has \\nan equally valid answer. Ãyurveda, like all of Ve-\\ndic philosophy, adheres to the belief in SanÃ¡tana \\ndharma , or accepting everything in its appropriate \\ntime and place, and rejecting nothing. All aspects \\nof medicine may be useful, but the appropriate \\ntreatment must be used when required. This is why \\nÃyurveda does not reject modern medicine. The \\nIndian temperament allows all religions to express \\nthemselves freely in India. Buddhism, Jainism, \\nand other religions grew in India and influenced \\nthe thinking of many people. Eventually, a time \\ncame when all religions lost some degree of their \\nspiritual link, and egos vied for first place. Gentle \\nspiritual medicine lost ground. Divisiveness was \\nfollowed by foreign conquest. Ãyurvedic colleg -\\nes were closed and books destroyed. One nation \\nforced Ãyurvedic doctors to add information on \\nmeat to the translations of the Ãyurvedic texts.\\nAnother religion did not believe in harming the \\nbody in any manner and destroyed the books on \\nÃyurvedic surgery. Nalanda , at Patna , India, a fa -\\nmous Ãyurvedic university, was the main univer -\\nsity at the center of the Silk Road, where students \\nfrom China, Tibet, the Middle East, and Europe \\ncame to study. This institution was among those \\ndestroyed by various conquerors. During the nine -\\nteenth and early twentieth centuries, the British \\nruled India and closed the remaining Ãyurvedic \\nuniversities (although Ãyurveda continued to be \\npracticed in secret). The knowledge was preserved \\nby the guru-Ã§hishya relationship (teacher-student) \\nand passed from one generation to the next by \\nword of mouth as it had centuries before. Finally, \\nin 1920 Ãyurveda reemerged and, with the help \\nof the Indian governmentâs assistance, universi -\\nties were rebuilt. Now more than 150 Ãyurvedic \\nuniversities and 100 Ãyurvedic colleges are flour -\\nishing in India, with plans for more educational \\nfacilities in development. Thus, Ãyurveda, with -\\nout resisting or rejecting other systems, is slowly \\nreturning to recognition and reestablishing its true \\nvalue. Keep in mind that just as some unethical western medical practices exist; unethical Ãy -\\nurvedic pharmacies and doctors can also be found \\nin India today.\\nThe oldest medicine, Ãyurveda, is now the last \\nto be rediscovered. This world medicine may not \\nonly unite healing practices, but also peoples, cul -\\ntures, and religions. The impact of its re-awaken -\\ning is astounding, as we see its effectiveness and \\ndemand in the United States growing in leaps and \\nbounds. Among the respected teachers of Ãyurve -\\nda, many include the original spiritual integration, \\nreestablishing ancient Ãyurveda, intact in modern \\nsociety. Spiritual Ãyurveda, the original world \\nmedicine, will soon find validation and universal \\nacceptance in all areas of society and the world.\\nWhat may surprise some people is the degree of \\ninsight these ancient, mystical doctors, or Ã½iÃ¤his \\n(seers) had. Without the aid of modern technolog -\\nical x-ray machines or CT-scans, they knew of the \\ninner workings of the human body. One can read \\nin the ancient Ãyurvedic texts of the development \\nof the fetus, month by month. It is astonishing how \\nthese ancient descriptions are validated by todayâs \\ntechnologies. Even the distance from the planets \\nand the duration of their orbits were nearly identi -\\ncal to todayâs technological measurements. It is \\nenough to make even the most skeptical of us sit \\nup and consider Ãyurvedic insights.\\nSo we see the foundation for the integration \\nof Ãyurveda and modern medicine. Too many \\npeople on both sides of the holistic-vs-allopathic \\n(modern) medicine debate want to deny the need \\nfor the other science. Because of Ãyurvedaâs all-\\nembracing philosophy, we see how all types of \\nhealing are compatible. No one will be put out of \\na job.\\nSpiritual Ãyurveda\\nWe have discussed Ãyurveda, \\nthe âscience of lifeâ as the original \\nworld medicine.

It said that \\neven if Ãyurvedic doctors had a complete knowl -\\nedge of Ãyurveda but could not reach the inner \\nSelf or soul of the patient, they would not be ef -\\nfective healers. Furthermore, if the practitioner \\nwere more concerned with fame and fortune, and \\nnot with spiritual development (Self-Realization), \\nthey would not be effective healers.\\nTo understand the spiritual nature of Ãyurveda, \\nwe must have insight into the Vedic roots of phi -\\nlosophy, spirituality, and universal religion. Ac -\\ncording to the ancient Vedic scriptures of India \\nthere is a goal to life. We are not simply born, \\nto live, and then to die without some meaning or \\npurpose. Albert Einstein reflected this idea when \\nhe said God does not play dice with the universe . \\nOrder and reason exist in life. According to Ve-\\ndic philosophy life is Divine and the goal of life is \\nto realize our inner Divine nature. Ãyurvedically \\nspeaking the more a person realizes their Divine \\nnature the healthier they are. Thus it is the respon -\\nsibility of the Ãyurvedic doctor to inspire or help \\nawaken the patients to their own inner Divine na -\\nture. Positive thinking or love is the best medicine. \\nWhen patients are taught they have this Divinity \\nwithin themselves, they feel a connection to life \\nand God (however each patient defines God). For \\natheists, we speak of the greater mystical power, \\nwhich is synonymous to God. This connection al -\\nlows patients to feel they have a handle on life and \\nan ability to develop their own inner nature. After \\nthis, secondary therapies of herbs, diet, medita -\\ntion, etc. are offered.\\nEven modern medical doctors are finding a link \\nbetween their healthy patients and the patientâs \\ndegree of spiritual faith. Spirituality changes the \\ndefinition of health, giving it an added dimension. \\nTwo types of health can now be seen diagnosed \\nhealth and true health. Often when a patient is di -\\nagnosed as healthy, they still may not feel healthy \\nor alive. This is due to psychosomatic conditions \\nwhere a troubled mind affects the health of the \\nbody. The deepest level of mental agitation is the \\nlonging for a deeper spiritual connection.Ãyurveda suggests true health is based on the \\nhealthy functioning of five areas of life; physi -\\ncal/mental health, career or life purpose, spiritual \\nrelationships (including personal and world ethics \\nand fair trade/living wage), ecology, and spiritual -\\nity. \\nFirst one needs to be physically and mentally \\nable to do work and play. Then persons need to \\nwork to support themselves and afford a social \\nlife. Work however is defined as making a living \\ndoing something meaningful or purposeful. To do \\nthis type of work one needs to use their innate \\nor God-given talents; they need to work at some -\\nthing they love to do. It is this love that cultures \\nspirituality.\\nAll too often we find people working at jobs \\nthat they dislike. Often people are forced into a \\nâpracticalâ career by parents or societal beliefs. \\nOther persons lack the self-worth and confidence \\nto challenge themselves to find and live their \\ndreams. Working in meaningless, unfulfilling jobs \\ncan create mental and physical disorders.\\nThe most extreme example of illness caused \\nby lack of purpose is cancer. Ãyurveda considers \\ncancer an emotionally caused disease. By not hav -\\ning a purpose in life (i.e., suppressing life) people \\ncreate life within their bodyâcancer. When seri -\\nously ill people discuss what they would love to \\ndo (instead of what they are told to do) life returns \\nto their eyes. As they begin to follow up on these \\nideas, some remarkable recoveries are seen. Pur -\\nposeful career is then an aspect of this new defini -\\ntion of health.\\nThe third realm of health is spiritual relation -\\nshipsâpersonal and global. When persons are \\nhealthy and purposefully working, they can now \\nbegin to truly enjoy their social life. These days \\nwe have become acutely aware of the emotional \\nand physical abuses that exist in many peopleâs \\nrelationships. Co-dependency and enabling are \\noften used terms to describe relationship diseases. \\nFrom the spiritual standpoint if one is dependent \\non anything other than God, co-dependency ex -\\nists.

The younger generation approached \\nthe elderly for wise counsel.

Now doctors and nurses working in nursing \\nhomes and hospices report one of the main issues \\nwith the elderly is depression, lack of social inte -\\ngration and life purpose. If society can realize the  \\nneed for the elderly to be reintegrated back into \\nsociety, everyoneâs health, emotions, and spirit \\nwill be enhanced.\\nThe global dimension of healthy spiritual re -\\nlationships says we must treat all people fairly, \\nethically, humanely. Today we see the great inter -\\nest in helping the less fortunate help themselves \\nthrough fair trade/living wage careers. There is a \\nVedic  saying, âhow can a person be fully happy \\nand content when even one person in the world is \\ncrying?â This idea originates in the original Vedic \\ntexts, that all of life is interdependent.  All things are connected like the blood that  \\nunites us all. Man did not weave the web  \\nof life, he is merely a strand in it.  \\nWhatever he does to the web, he does to himself.  \\nChief Seattle\\nSo if part of the web of life is suffering, it will \\naffect the other parts of the web as well. There -\\nfore, Ãyurveda admonishes us to have a good re -\\nlationship with all our brothers and sisters around \\nthe globe.\\nThe fourth area of life is really an extension of \\nidea of the global web. Atharva Veda  is full of \\nhymns praising the earth, water, air, fire, wind, \\ngrass and trees. Today, this an under-discussed \\naspect of Ãyurveda. In many cases feeling con -\\nnected to nature is the most powerful medicine; \\nherbs are used as a last resort.\\nIf we donât praise Mother Nature through car -\\ning for her, her illnesses become our illnesses. \\nFor example, with the rise of air pollution, how \\ncan we be surprised with the simultaneous rise in \\nchildhood asthma.

Personal spiritual development is seen on \\nmany levels. The body becomes more relaxed, \\nthe mind more calm and alert; and one becomes \\nmore personable in relationships. Yet the most \\nprofound developments take place inwardly; Di -\\nvinity grows within. Gradually one also begins to \\nsee the Divinity in others and all of life.\\nThis is the interdependent, multi-dimensional, \\nspiritual definition of health according to Ãy -\\nurveda.

There was \\nno separation of life into parts. the Vedas speak of \\na past golden age, a Sat Yuga , where was not even \\nthe notion of a God as separate from the rest of \\nlifeâall was one sacred harmony. God was har-\\nmony, love and caring; and all this was also called \\nhealth. [Many spiritual authorities suggest the Sat \\nYuga is dawning again.]\\nSo when considering healing, Ãyurveda looks \\nto the root cause or underlying reasons of illness. \\nThe body may be sick because of mental or career \\nstress. Rather than instruct the patient to merely \\ntake a drug or an herb to heal the physical con -\\ndition, the practitioner of Ãyurvedic medicine \\nlooks to restore balance within the patient (e.g., \\ncalming the mind or finding a more purposeful \\njob, or looking at their environment). The deep -\\nest root level is spiritual development. Thus, all \\nfive areas of life must be cultivated; mind/body, \\ncareer, spiritual relationships, and inner spiritual \\ndevelopment.\\nThe Development of   \\nAllopathic Medicine\\nNot long ago in America herbal and \\nnaturopathic medicines were the common healing \\nmodalities. Grandmothers and mothers gave fam -\\nily members natural or herbal remedies when they \\nwere sick. \\nParallel to the onset of the industrial revolution, \\nrose allopathic medicineânot because it was bet -\\nter, but because more money was available for \\nits propagation. A chief developer of allopathic \\nmedicine was Andrew Carnegie, who saw a bet -\\nter financial future for himself in investing large \\nsums of money to develop allopathic research \\nand diagnostic machinery instead of encouraging \\nnatural medicine research. Thus allopathy had the \\nbacking to develop and surpass natural medicine.\\nThis statement is not meant to discredit the effec -\\ntiveness and usefulness of modern medicine, but \\nmerely intended to underline the point that herbal medicine was also an effective healing method, but \\nit was swept under the rug in the name of progress \\nand was viewed less enthusiastically. Now, due to \\ndifficult economic times, the high cost of medi -\\ncal care, and hazardous side effects from drugs, \\npeople have been forced to return to alternative \\nmeasures for relief. As with any groundswell at \\nthe grassroots, when something works the word \\ngets out. People are returning to alternative or \\ncomplimentary health-care in droves.\\nSelf-Healing & Self-Realization\\nThe main theme of Ãyurveda is that people can \\nadequately educate themselves to take control of \\ntheir own health. This is achieved by monitoring \\nand balancing oneâs nutritional and lifestyle hab -\\nits to heal, prevent illness, and develop longevity. \\nMoreover, one needs to balance the health of the \\nouter world as well because it significantly in -\\nfluences personal health. Ecological houses and \\nbuilding materials (not emitting carcinogens), \\nnon-toxic home and garden products, clean air \\nand water, and organic foods and clothing all con -\\ntribute to the health of the society and the health \\nof the individual. Research studies are already \\nshowing the correlation between environmental \\ntoxicity and physical and emotional health. \\nIn short, we are in a time when the original, ho -\\nlistic and spiritual Ãyurveda originally discussed  \\nin the Atharva Veda is again becoming more in \\ndemand again. People are searching for spiri -\\ntual connection, and meaning in life. Even after \\nÃyurvedic herbs help restore their bodysâ and \\nmindsâ, they are seeking a greater experience of \\nthe wholeness of life.\\n Ãyurveda teaches that people are their own \\nbest healers. Oneâs intuition is better at discerning \\nsubtle health imbalances than relying on another \\nperson. All that is needed is some basic guidelines \\noffered by the Ãyurvedic practitioner.\\nThe ability to take control of oneâs health in -\\nspires self-worth and self-empowerment.

Realizing one has the ability \\nto take control of oneâs own health is itself a key \\nfactor in healing.\\nSelf-reliance is also the most important com -\\nponent in spiritual development. Individuals can \\nlearn to rely on their own intuition [along with \\nguidelines laid out by oneâs spiritual mentor or \\nguru and from the scriptures]. As one begins to \\nsee positive results developing in their spiritual \\nlife, doubts begin to vanish: clarity, confidence, \\nand mental peace begin to dawn. \\nThe mental peace of Self-Realization is said to \\nbe the true state of life because it is eternal, non-\\nchanging. Vedic Ã§hastras (scriptures) speak of the \\nthree legs of truth; what the scriptures say, what \\nthe guru or spiritual guide says, and what one ex -\\nperiences for oneself. Only when all three sources \\nare found to be saying the same thing is some -\\nthing accepted as truth. But it is personal experi -\\nence that must also be known; it is not enough to \\nfollow something dogmatically with blind faith.\\nDoubts are mental agitation. When doubts are \\ndispelled the mind gains a state of peace. In Self-\\nRealization one knows truth in its eternal nature; \\nthey cannot be swayed or agitated. The first step \\ntowards Self-Realization is developing the abil -\\nity to not be swayed by others if you experience \\nthings differently. The American poet Thoreau, \\nafter reading the Vedic scriptures, expressed it this \\nway:\\nIf a man cannot keep pace with his compan -\\nions,  \\nperhaps it is because he hears the beat  \\nof a different drummer.  \\nLet him step to the beat he hears,  \\nno matter how measured or far away.\\n The Ãyurvedic practitioner instills this philoso -\\nphy in the patient, who then experiences and re -\\nspects inner intuition and Divinity. When patients \\nsee that the practitioner believes they have such \\nDivine qualities, they usually respond in kind.A psychological study highlights the value of \\nexpectation. Two teachers were given classes of \\nstudents with average abilities. One teacher was \\ntold their class was above average while the other \\nteacher was told they had an average class. The \\nfirst teacher went to class expecting exceptional \\nwork from the students and treated them accord -\\ningly. The other teacher just taught the average \\ncurriculum. The supposed above average class \\nperformed above average. Thus, when the Ãy -\\nurvedic practitioner treats patients with respect, \\nrecognizing their inner intuitive abilities, the pa -\\ntients automatically develop a greater sense of \\nself-worth and faith that they can take control of \\ntheir health.\\nAs self-worth develops, people are not as eas -\\nily swayed by peer pressure, whether pressed to \\ntake drugs or lead an unethical life. Low self-es -\\nteem causes people to abuse themselves. Having \\nsomeone recognize oneâs inner Divinity and self-\\nhealing abilities develops confidence. Experienc -\\ning positive results from self-healing and spiritual \\ndevelopment further generates confidence, health, \\nmental peace, and Divinity. \\nExperiencing Atharva Veda\\nThere are three foundations expressed in Athar -\\nva Veda\\n1.\\n \\nEverything in life is a part of the cosmic \\nweb; humans, societies, animals, and nature are \\nall interdependentâwhat affects one affects all. \\nBy oneâs actions [or lack of action], a person con -\\nstantly affects this âreal-timeâ web of life.

The very elements of human \\nlife exist outside in the cosmos as well. As the poet \\nWalt Whitman said, âI believe a blade of grass is \\nno less than the journey-work of the stars.â In or -\\nder to understand the universe and environmental \\nsituations, and to understand human health con -\\ncerns, one needs to appreciate the common link \\nbetween them: the elements of creation.\\nThe Vedas discuss the process of creation. First, \\nthere was the eternal, Divine, unmanifest exis -\\ntence: ever present. It is said that life was created \\nfrom within the eternal, like a thread that comes \\nfrom within a spider to be woven into a web. Cre -\\nation eventually dissolves back into the eternal \\nlike the spider returning the web into itself.\\nOne may ask how the nonmoving eternal can \\nappear to move or create something. Here, the Ve-\\ndic literature, known as the UpaniÃ¤hads , offers a \\nmetaphor: Just as the desert appears to create an \\noasis without moving to create it, so does the non -\\nmoving eternity appear to produce this illusory \\ncreation. The creation is called illusory because \\nit is not lasting; only eternity is real because it is \\neverlasting. \\nThere is not enough space in this book to justly \\ndiscuss this topic. This is a mere offering into the \\ninsight of the origin of creation as explained by \\nthe ancient Vedic ^ishis (seers).\\nAs creation developed, it formed three underly -\\ning principles that uphold all life: the laws of cre -\\nation, maintenance, and dissolution. Everything \\nin life is born or created, it lives, and then it dies. \\nThese principles are known as sattwa, rajas, and \\ntamas , respectfully, and are called the three guÃ²as or tendencies. All of life, human and celestial, \\nobey these laws.\\nThe Elements: Building Blocks of Life\\nThe creation principle developed five essential \\nelementsâor building blocks that all life forms \\ncontain: ether, air, fire, water, and earth. We can \\neasily see how life was created from the subtlest \\nto the grossest matter. From eternity, the subtlest \\nform of matter is ether. Ether mixing with eternity \\ncreates air, a more observable or experiential ele -\\nment. As air moves, it eventually creates friction, \\nwhich creates heat or fire. Heat produces mois -\\nture, thus creating water, the densest element yet: \\nif one tries to walk through water, one is slowed \\nby its density. Finally, water produces the densest \\nform of matter, earth. The Vedas say that all of the \\ncreation, including humans, is made up of combi -\\nnations of all five essential elements. These ele -\\nments are the subtlest aspects of human life, finer \\nthan the molecular, atomic, or subatomic levels.\\nThis is the level that Ãyurvedic healing works \\non. Focusing on the cause of the grosser levels \\nof life, the denser aspects will be taken care of \\nsince they are made up of these five elements. Just \\nas a strong foundation supports a strong building, \\nwhen the five elements (the foundation of all mat -\\nter) are strong and balanced in a person, they will \\nautomatically balance the more material levels.\\nThus, Ãyurveda does not need to look at isolat -\\ned parts of the human anatomy, or at the vitamin, \\nchemical, or nutritional level of health. It simply \\nbalances the elements, and this balances the more \\nphysical levels.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Rather than create a \\nname for a symptom, Ãyurveda identifies the ill -\\nness as an excess of the fire element. Acid is a \\nby-product of heat. Ãyurveda will look to see in \\nwhat part of the patientâs life overheating occurs. \\nIt may be due to eating excessive fiery foods and \\nspices like tomatoes and peppers. Oneâs career \\nmay be causing undue anger (i.e., hot temper). \\nPerhaps the person drinks alcohol (firewater). \\nOnce the cause is learned, suggestions for re -\\nducing a personâs excessive intake of fire are dis -\\ncussed. Simultaneously, the patient is advised to \\nuse more of the air and water elements to balance \\nthe heat with coolness (air cools heat, water puts \\nout the fire). Thus, the holistic approach of Ãy -\\nurveda seeks the cause of an illness and restores \\nbalance, using the insight of the elemental cre -\\nation of the universe. \\nThe Ãyurvedic Body\\nPersonalizing the healing process is a unique -\\nness that Ãyurveda brings to the holistic field of \\nhealth. From the insights of the Vedic sages, we \\nlearn that people are different and need to be indi -\\nvidually treated.\\nExpanding upon this elemental view, the Ãy -\\nurvedic practitioner understands that people are \\nmade up of various combinations of the elements. \\nSome people have more air in their system; some \\npeople have a more fiery constitution. Others are \\npredominantly made up of water. Still others are \\ncombinations of fire and air, fire and water, or air \\nand water. Some people have an equal amount of \\nall three elements (ether is combined in air and \\nearth within water). \\nThus a more air-predominant individual needs \\nto take in less air and more fire and water. A water \\nperson already has an excess of water, so there is a \\nneed to reduce the intake of water and to increase \\nthe fire and air elements in the diet and lifestyle.\\nWhen we discuss the Ãyurvedic view of the \\nbody, we are discussing all levels, from the cells, to the organs, to the systems (e.g, respiratory), and \\nto external systems such as environment, social, \\neducational, and political. All aspects of creation, \\nfrom the micro to the macro, have an âhealth in -\\nterdependencyâ with one another. \\n \\nPersonalized Healing\\nThe general Ãyurvedic approach is threefold. \\n1. Determining oneâs elemental constitution \\n(doÃha or prak^iti ),\\n2. Learning the elemental cause of illness \\n(vik^iti ), and \\n3. Applying therapeutic recommendations to \\nbalance elements causing the illness, without \\ncausing an imbalance to the doÃha (constitution).\\nThis unique, personalized approach not only \\nmakes healing effective, but gentle as well. Other \\nholistic measures may work, yet still aggravate \\nthe personâs doÃha . Ãyurveda is the only holistic \\nscience that neednât warn people that they may \\nfeel worse while the diseases or toxins are being \\nremoved before they will feel better. Because of \\nits balancing approach, gentleness marks the en -\\ntire healing process.\\nQualities of the Three DoÃhas\\nParallel to the three guÃ²as (sattwa, rajas, and \\ntamas ) in creation are the three doÃhas , or consti -\\ntutions, in the human body: VÃ¡yu (or VÃ¡ta), Pitta, \\nand Kapha.

Ãyurveda/Allopathy Parallels\\nThere are a number of ideas Ãyurveda pur -\\nports that, at first glance, seem rather alien to \\nWestern medicine. Ãyurveda states that the \\ncolon is the main seat of VÃ¡yu doÃha , and that \\nthe majority of bodily diseases are due to poor \\ndigestion; giving prime importance to properly \\nworking digestion.

These are examples \\nof the influence of stress on the enteric nervous \\nand endocrine systems (ENS, EES)âclose par -\\nallels to VÃ¡yu and Pitta doÃha  functions. \\nAlong with people directly experiencing a \\nlink between emotions, digestion, and elimi -\\nnation, Western medicine has slowly begun to \\naccept this idea that was first introduced to al -\\nlopathic medicine in the early 1900âs , of the \\nENSâa collection of neurons in the gastroin -\\ntestinal tract (GIT) that many Western doctors \\nconsider the âbrain of the gutâ (home of VÃ¡yu), \\nthat can function independently of the Central \\nNervous System (CNS).

The ENS is complex and expansive, \\ncontaining as many neurons as the spinal cord. \\nThe ENS, along with the sympathetic and para -\\nsympathetic nervous systems, constitute the au -\\ntonomic nervous system. \\nThe second of the two enteric systems control -\\nling digestion is the endocrine system, which \\nregulates function by secreting hormones.

From inadequate, excessive or untimely \\nsensory experiences  (e.g., excessive loud music, \\novereating)\\n3. Actions  (e.g., excessive speaking, inadequate \\nexercise, etc.)Agnis: Digestive Fire (Enzymes)\\nMost diseases are due to poor digestion. Agnis \\ncan be thought of as enzymes and endocrine fac -\\ntors governing all digestive and metabolic func -\\ntioning. The normal digestion of the three doÃhas \\nproduces SamÃ¡gni . Digestive activity (healthy, \\ndeficient or excessive) is governed by the doÃhas \\nbecoming aggravated. The three doÃhas produce \\nthree agnis (viÃhamÃ¡gni, tÃ­kÃhnÃ¡gni and mandÃ¡g -\\nni respectively). Excess VÃ¡yu in the body produc -\\nes weak, irregular digestion, and causes gas.\\nExcess Pitta creates a situation like an over -\\nheated furnace. Food burns up quickly, and per -\\nsons experience burning sensations, thirst, acid \\nindigestion, etc. In some cases the agni fire even \\nburns up nutrients, causing malnutrition.\\nWhen excess Kapha is in the digestive tract, the \\ndigestive fire is low, making it difficult to digest \\nany foods. As a result, a person feels dull, poor, \\ninadequate, and lethargic; the stomach is heavy, \\nor the person may experience constipation. VÃ¡yu \\ndisorders produce hard stools from the dryness \\ncaused by gas. Pitta stools are soft or liquid due to \\nexcess heat. Kapha stools are moderate. A healthy \\nstool is also moderate and easily eliminated once \\nor twice a day. \\nThirteen agnis reside in the body and are re -\\nsponsible for digestion, \\nJaÃ¾harÃ¡gni : The chemical processes working \\nmainly in the gastrointestinal tract; responsible \\nfor alimentary digestion, governs basic digestion \\nand the 12 other agnis . It is equivalent to PÃ¡chaka \\nPitta (see page 19). \\n5 BhÃºtÃ¡gnis : They metabolize the five elements \\nat the molecular level. They are a form of heat \\nthat is always present in all the tissues that are \\nresponsible for proper function and development \\nof the tissues. Some authorities ascribe the liver \\nenzymes as BhÃºtÃ¡gnis. This is because digested \\nfood must go to the liver for metabolism (e.g., the \\nliver converts amino acids into glucose and glu -\\ncose into glycogen or fat). \\n7 DhÃ¡tagnis : This process occurs after BhÃºtÃ¡g -\\nnis; DhÃ¡tagnis metabolize in the seven tissues ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Excessive \\nsex, drugs, talking, loud music, insufficient rest or \\nburnout, and high technology deplete Ojas . Signs \\nof diminished ojas are fear, worry, sensory organ \\npain, poor complexion, cheerlessness, roughness, \\nemaciation, immune system disorders, and easily \\ncontracting diseases.\\nIn the same way Pitta and agni are related, so \\ntoo, Kapha and ojas are similar. When kapha is \\nin its normal state it is ojas or balaâstrength (to \\nresist disease).

They are more \\ncomfortable with practical knowledge than with abstract ideas.\\nSattwic influence creates calmness, peace, love, \\ncompassion, faith, nurturing, and forgiveness. \\nRajasic influence creates greed for money, ma -\\nterial luxuries, and comfort.

Consequently, \\nwhen suggesting healing measures for the Kapha \\nbody illness, the practitioner takes care not to ag -\\ngravate the VÃ¡yu mental constitution. \\nIn this example, fire-increasing measures are \\nrecommended, including herbs, foods, and aro -\\nmas, but not air-increasing ones. Mental disease \\nis related to rajas and tamas , the activity and leth -\\nargy principles of the three guÃ²as (qualities). The \\nguÃ²as also reflect the level of the soulâs develop -\\nment. If the mind is sattwic, or pure, then clar -\\nity exists. A sattwic -minded person perceives the \\nknowledge of Divinity. A sattwic mind is also the \\nfirst stage of samÃ¡dhi . Poor mental discrimination \\nis the cause of all illness, making one dishonest, \\nself-destructive, and hurtful to others. One would \\noverindulge in âjunk food,â entertainment, etc. \\nThe best way to heal is by following a sattwic \\nlifestyle. This includes meditation, compassion -\\nate actions, ethical and virtuous behavior, healthy, \\norganic foods, and living within the rhythms of \\nnature. People in whom sattwa predominates, see \\nthe good in all things (including the value an ill -\\nness may offer), and they are the healthiest people \\nas well.\\nTamas creates lethargy, dullness, and a cloudy \\nperception.

When this mental quality is predomi -\\nnant, such persons will suppress their emotions. \\nEmotional suppression is a major cause of severe \\nillness, like cancer. Stagnancy describes their \\nemotional makeup. Negative mindedness and \\nself-destruction define their personality.\\nRajas causes a turbulent, or distracted, mind. It \\nmakes one look outside for comfort and fulfill -\\nment. It causes one to seek external validation. \\nRajas makes one think love is derived from an ex -\\nternal relationship, not from within. It makes one \\nwillful, egoistic, and manipulative.\\nWhen rajas and tamas exist in the mind simul -\\ntaneously, activity is devoted to greedy purposes. \\nThese persons also overextend themselves for \\nthose ends. They blame others for their condition \\nand expect others to cure them. \\nWhen rajas is free from a trace of tamas , it \\nthen can develop purer activities, like studying or \\nlearning about health and spirituality. Yet the ra-\\njasic -minded person may still burn out during the \\nlearning process.\\nOften, just as people have some qualities of all \\nthree doÃhas , that mind has some of each guÃ²a . \\nSeven mental guÃ²a types exist: sattwa, rajas, \\ntamas, sattwa-rajas, sattwa-tamas, rajas-tamas, \\nand triguÃ²a (equal amounts of the three guÃ²as ). \\nJust as external factors may cause doÃha derange -\\nment, the rajasic nature of our modern techno -\\nlogical society may cause mental rajasic derange -\\nments.\\nMental Qualities: PrÃ¡Ã²a, Tejas & Ojas\\nThe mind has three governing agents similar to \\nVÃ¡yu, Pitta, and Kapha. They are called prÃ¡Ã²a \\n(air), tejas (fire), and ojas (life sap). Again, it is the \\nbalance of these three elements that decide mental \\nbalance and clarity. Too much prÃ¡Ã²a will create \\nanxiety, worry, insomnia, and loss of memory and \\nconcentration. (This prÃ¡Ã²a is different from the \\nair we think of as respiration. Here, prÃ¡Ã²a means \\nlife-force, soul, or kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ Â¤hakti ). Excess prÃ¡Ã²a dries up ojas, the sap that creates oneâs spiri -\\ntual life sap. Through meditation, ojas becomes \\ntransmuted into life energy, or â kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ Â¤hakti ,â \\nwhich develops oneâs Self-realization. Spiritually \\nspeaking, an undetectable tube runs up the middle \\nof our spine called the â suÃhumÃ²Ã¡ â in which the \\nkuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ energy travels. Without this Â¤hakti en-\\nergy, not only is our physical and mental health \\nused up, but also so is our spiritual development. \\nExcess tejas also depletes ojas by burning it up, \\nwhereas excess ojas can create a lethargic per -\\nson.\\nDoÃhas and the Organs\\nEach organ is primarily governed by one doÃha . \\nBy knowing which doÃha controls which organs, \\none achieves the health of the appropriate organ, \\nthrough balancing the elements ( doÃhas )\\nVÃ¡yu Pitta Kapha\\ncolon* small intestine* stomach*\\nbrain liver lungs\\nthighs spleen pericardium\\nbones gall bladder triple warmer\\nkidney kidney\\nurinary \\nbladderheart urinary blad -\\nder\\npancreas pancreas pancreas\\nuterus testes\\n* Origin Sites of the doÃhas\\n \\nBy merely knowing which doÃha is related to \\nwhich tissue layer and body system, Ãyurveda can \\nidentify and bring balance to health problems.

Srotas are the channels, pores, \\nor systems that carry or circulate the doÃhas and \\ntissues ( dhÃ¡tus ) or their elements to the various \\norgans; and are a medium of transport of wastes. \\nDuring this process of circulation the dhÃ¡tus \\nare transformed from the first to the last tissue \\nlayer ( rasa through Â¤hukra ). Each dhÃ¡tu has two \\naspects: nutrition for its own tissue layer, and sus -\\ntenance for the next developing dhÃ¡tu .\\nIt is then easy to understand how a defect (i.e., \\ndeficiency, excess) of a srota channel is the basic \\ncause of all disorders. If a channel does not re -\\nceive or send proper nutrition, its own and all sub -\\nsequent srotas will become imbalanced. Channels \\nneed to be clean and permeable so the flow and \\ntransfer of their contents can process normally.\\nÃyurveda notes 15 systems, several more than \\nthose that are currently considered. The origin \\nsites, which carry each dhÃ¡tu,  are listed on the \\nnext page.\\nThere are three levels of srotas, \\n1. 13 large systems like respiratory, digestive \\nsystems (see chart on the next page).\\n2. Many moderate systems (e.g., tubes, blood  \\nvessles, capillaries, lymph, bronchioles, bili -\\nary channels, tubules). These channels function \\nthrough the endomembrane systme and the endo -thelium.\\n3. Cellular and subcellular systems like mem -\\nbranes and pores. \\nIn addition to the 15 physical systems, Ãy -\\nurveda notes the mind (sometimes referred to as \\nthe nervous system) as Manovaha Srotas , which \\nincludes the organs related to the mind ( manas ). \\nThey include the brain ( mastuluÂ´ga ) and nerves \\n(nÃ¡Ã¦is ), the 5 sense organs ( paÃ±cha jÃ±Ã¡nendri -\\nyas), the 5 motor organs ( paÃ±cha karmendriyas) , \\nand the mind.

These channels function through the en -\\ndomembrane system and the endothelium.\\n \\nMind (Manovaha Srotas)\\nÃyurveda describes the mind ( manas ) as the \\nmediator between the sense organs and the Soul \\n(Ãtma ).

Also, Ãyurveda says \\nthat the majority of bodily diseases are due to poor \\ndigestion, and gives prime importance to properly \\nworking digestion. Neither of these ideas are pres -\\nently accepted in mainstream western medicine.\\nStill, many people find their digestion impaired \\nwhile experiencing undue stress. For example, \\nwhen taking an exam, about to have an important \\nmeeting, or after an intense argument, one may \\nexperience diarrhea or constipation, or develop \\nimpaired digestion. These are examples of the \\ninfluence of stress on the enteric nervous and en -\\ndocrine systems. In addition to peopleâs directly \\nexperiencing a link between emotions, digestion, \\nand elimination, western medicine has slowly be -\\ngun to accept this idea that was first introduced to \\nallopathic medicine in the early 1900âs .\\nIn the west, there is a growing acceptance of the \\nenteric nervous system â a collection of neurons \\nin the GIT that western doctors consider the âbrain \\nof the gutâ, that can function independently of the \\nCentral Nervous System. ENS controls motility, \\nexocrine, and endocrine secretions, and microcir -\\nculation of the GIT, and regulates the immune and \\ninflammatory processes. The ENS is so complex \\nand expansive that it contains as many neurons as \\nthe spinal cord. The ENS, along with the sympa -\\nthetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, con -\\nstitute the autonomic nervous system.\\nThe main components of the ENS are two neu -\\nron networks or plexuses that are in the digestive \\ntract wall, extending from esophagus to anus. The \\nmyenteric plexus principally controls digestive \\ntract motility; and the sub-mucous plexus mainly \\nsenses the environment within the lumen, regu -\\nlating gastrointestinal blood flow and controlling \\nepithelial cell function.\\nEnteric Endocrine System (EES)\\nThe second of the two enteric systems control -\\nling digestion is the endocrine system, which \\nregulates function by secreting hormones. Diges -gans discussed in the Vedic texts such as Upa-\\nniÃhads , that modern science has yet to discover. \\nInside the spine is the suÃ§humnÃ¡  and surrounded \\nby the two main nÃ¡Ã¦is, iÃ¦Ã¡  and piÂ´galÃ¡.  Situated \\nalong the suÃ§humnÃ¡  are the chakras  (energy plex -\\nuses). These are discussed in detail in Chapter 9 \\nand 10.\\n \\nEndocrine System   \\n(AntaÃ a ÃrÃ¡vÃ­ Granthi Srotas)\\nSome authorities like Srikanthmurthy, suggest \\nthe endocrine system is also not uniquely identi -\\nfied by ancient Ãyurvedic texts, and can be con -\\nsidered the 15th srotas system.\\nUsing cross-referencing, by knowing a symp -\\ntom, Ãyurveda can find the imbalanced srota .\\nSrotas include, veins ( Â¤hirÃ¡ ), arteries ( dhamanÃ­ ), \\ncapillaries ( rasavahini ), ducts ( nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­), passages \\n(pantha ), tracts ( marga ), spaces inside the body \\n(Â¤harÃ­rachidra ), ducts [open at one end and \\nclosed at the other] ( samvritÃ¡samvrita ), residence \\n(sthÃ¡na ), containers ( Ã¡Ãhaya ), and abodes ( nike-\\nta). They are the visible and invisible areas in the \\nbodyâs tissue elements. Affliction of these srotas \\ncreates vitiation of the tissues that reside there or \\npass through them (i.e., vitiation of one, leads to \\ndepletion of the other). VÃ¡yu and Kapha doÃhas \\ncause vitiation of the srotas and tissue elements \\n(Charak SaÃ¥hitÃ¡ - VimÃ¡nasthÃ¡na Ch. 5 verse 9).\\nModern Recognition of   \\nÃyurvedic Views\\nThe Ãyurvedic relationship between the ner -\\nvous, endocrine, and digestion system has only \\nbegun to be accepted in western medicine. \\nEnteric Nervous System (ENS)\\nThere are a number of ideas Ãyurveda purports \\nthat, at first glance, seem rather alien to western \\nmedicine.

Upon receiving \\nchemical âmessagesâ from an appropriate ligand \\nor binder (e.g., steroids, neurotransmitters, and \\npeptides), the information is communicated into \\nthe cell. The result is the cell itself may change \\ndramatically. \\nAlso at the junction of two cellular membranes \\nelectrical currents, ions, and small molecules like \\nnucleotides, sugars, vitamins, and other metabo -\\nlites  pass in and out of the cells.\\nThere are various forms of diffusion, but the \\nessential point from the Ãyurvedic standpoint is \\nthat diffusion into or out of a cell is a form of \\ntransport system, thus falling into the category \\nof micro- srotas . Thus the body can be seen as a \\nhighly complex network of passages in which nu -\\ntrition and/or communication flows through gross \\nto subtle channels or srotas.\\nIn the case of ligands, which are only able to \\nbind with certain receptors - Ãyurveda should be \\nable to classify ligands and receptors according to \\nthe 16 srotas  depending on which srotas they are \\ninvolved with.The 13 Natural Urges\\n     Ãyurveda, we have already said, emphasizes \\ngentle and natural methods.

Environmental factors \\ninclude spiritual ( karmic ) situations such as past \\nlife influences.\\n2. Lifestyle outweighs environment\\nFollowing a lifestyle that balances their doÃha \\nprotects people from environmental aggravations \\n(i.e., cold weather will not seriously affect VÃ¡yu \\npersons if they take measures to keep warm).\\n3.

Health is \\nthe basis of life, so living a healthy lifestyle (i.e., \\nwholesome diet and lifestyle, and adequate rest,) \\nis essential. Living a long life without adequate fi -\\nnancial resources is sure to promote troubles. The \\ngoal of life, according to Ãyurvedic precepts, is \\nSelf-Realization. By living a healthy life and not \\nbeing troubled by financial matters, persons have \\nthe time to focus on the prime goal of life. Thus \\nÃyurveda suggests people live lives of charity, \\ncompassion, nonviolence, celibacy, devotion to \\nDivinity and sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation) or prayer (see \\nthe discussion on Yama and Niyama in Chapter \\n13). These measures help to develop oneâs Self-\\nRealization. By ignoring these principles, people \\nare forced to be reborn repeatedly until they fol -\\nlow these measures and gain Self-Realization.\\nManagement of the DoÃhas\\nVÃ¡yu is reduced through heat and moistness.     \\nPitta is reduced through leisure and cold.  \\n     Kapha is reduced through heat, dry, and lightness.\\nVÃ¡yu (ApÃ¡n VÃ¡yu) gathers and becomes exces -\\nsive while food is in the large intestine  (originat -\\ning site). Western medicine has a parallel view. \\nCarbohydrates become fermented and proteins \\nbecome putrefied. This produces gas in the colon. \\nVÃ¡yu is alleviated when food is in the stomach. \\nThis is why it is suggested that VÃ¡yu individuals \\nhave a meal every 3-4 hours. In this way, putting \\nfood in the stomach reduces the VÃ¡yu accumu -\\nlated since the last meal. Because the colon is the \\norgan that is the main site of VÃ¡yu and mostly af -\\nfects air, Ãyurveda recommends enemas (bastis) \\nto cleanse the excess VÃ¡yu from the colon.\\nPitta gathers and becomes excessive when food \\nis in the duodenum and small intestine  (originat -\\ning site). It is reduced when the food reaches the \\ncolon. Thus, an excess of Pitta may create heart -\\nburn about two hours after meals. Because the \\nsmall intestine is the main site of Pitta, purgation \\n(virechana ) is recommended. From the western point of view, the Pitta ( Pachaka Pitta) is parallel \\nto the digestive enzymes secreted by the pancre -\\nas, liver, etc. that are active in the duodenum and \\nsmall intestine.\\nKapha gathers and becomes excessive in the \\nstomach just after eating ( Kledaka Kapha). Kapha \\nmoistens the food and passes it on to the small in -\\ntestine for the action of Pitta. It is the sluggishness \\nof Kapha that causes one to feel sleepy after eating \\na meal. If an excess of Kapha develops, one may \\nfeel nauseous or want to vomit just after eating. \\nKapha is relieved when food is in the small intes -\\ntine. The parallels to Kapha in western medicine \\nare mucoid secretions and saliva. When food is \\neaten, secretions from the mucus membranes (in \\nthe intestines) moisten the food. These secretions \\nfrom the lungs rise into the trachea (from the cili -\\nary action) and move to the throat. Then the secre -\\ntions are swallowed and move down the esopha -\\ngus and finally, into the stomach. Ãyurveda calls \\nthese excess secretions water, or Kapha. In West -\\nern medicine expectorants are used to remove the \\nexcess secretions. These expectorants have minor \\nemetic properties. In large doses, these expecto -\\nrants cause vomiting (emesis). Likewise, Kapha \\ndoÃha is balanced by vaman (emesis). [See dia -\\ngram below]\\n \\nPath of Food Moistening Secretions \\n1. Ciliary action\\nmoves \\nsecretions\\nupward2.

If the digestive fire ( agni) does not burn \\nstrongly enough, foods do not get digested. If \\nfood is not digested, nutrients cannot be absorbed. \\nWhen foods do not get digested, they sit and accu -\\nmulate in the colon, becoming a breeding ground \\nfor yeast infections, toxins, gas, and constipation. \\nUndigested foods are called Ã¡ma. Ãma is the root \\ncause of most problems in the body, resulting \\nfrom excess VÃ¡yu or Kapha (or both). If the agni \\nburns too much, heat and acid build up in the sys -\\ntem, creating Pitta problems.\\nDigestion begins in the mouth and stomach as \\nsaliva acts upon the food to digests it. PrÃ¡Ã²a  VÃ¡yu \\nmoves the food from the mouth to the stomach \\n(Ã¡mÃ¡Ãhaya ). Once in the stomach the food takes \\non a predominantly sweet ( madhura ) taste. Food \\nmixes with the digestive enzymes ( Pachaka Pit-\\nta). SamÃ¡na VÃ¡yu moves the food to the duode -\\nnum ( grahanÃ­ ) where digestion continues due to \\nthe digestive fire or agni (koÃÃ³hÃ¡gni ), assuming a \\npungent taste. The liver and pancreas are involved \\nin the digestive process.\\nFinally, the large intestine (VÃ¡yu) absorbs the \\nair and ether elements. Here, undigested foods \\nbecome feces, and water is absorbed, transferred, \\nand eliminated through the urine.\\nProperly digested food creates nutritional es -\\nsence, chyle, or plasma ( rasa). Improperly digest -\\ned food becomes undigested food toxins ( Ã¡ma) \\nthat are the cause of most diseases. Earth foods \\nbuild protein bulk, such as muscles. Watery foods \\nbuild vital fluids and fat. Fiery foods build en -\\nzymes and hemoglobin. Air foods build bone and \\nnerve plexuses, and ether foods build the mind.\\nThe health of the immune system determines \\nwhether diseases are warded off. Ãyurveda notes \\nthat there is a sap-like material called ojas (per-\\nhaps analogous to pineal gland secretion) that \\ncoats the immune system and protects it from dis -\\nease. If the agni fire is too low or too high, this \\nlife sap will be diminished. Just like the tree that \\ncreates a sap over the bruise in the bark to protect and heal the bruise, our life sap ( ojas) protects \\nand heals us from illness.\\nToo much dryness or too much heat and fire \\neats away the life sap. A weak immune system \\nis the cause of all illness, from colds to multiple \\nsclerosis to AIDS. To heal the immune system, \\none needs adequate rest and pure ( sattwic ) foods \\nand herbs that specifically rebuild the ojas (life \\nsap). Examples include blanched almonds or ta -\\nhini, and ojas building herbs like Â¤hatÃ¡varÃ­ and \\naÂ¤hwagandhÃ¡ , respectively.\\nSummary\\nSo, we have seen that by knowing the constitu -\\ntion and elemental cause of oneâs illness ( vik^iti ), \\nby knowing which tissue layers ( dhÃ¡tus ), sys -\\ntems, and organs are governed by which doÃha , \\nand by knowing how to balance the agni fire and \\nbuild the ojas, Ãyurveda offers an individualized, \\nsimple, gentle, and effective form of healing.\\nAll diseases can be caused by any of the hu -\\nmors, depending on which sites they relocate to, \\nso the patient is examined completely, using all \\npossible methods. Since disease development \\n(pathogenesis) is the same for all doÃhas , only the \\nhumors, stages, sites, and directional movement \\nof the humors are examined. Humors have to re -\\nturn to their origin sites to be eliminated . \\nÃyurveda emphasizes promoting health, pre -\\nventing disease, and enhancing longevity (rejuve -\\nnation or age reversal).

This is why the ancients advised med -\\nitation and self-reflection first, and the world will \\nunfold for us automatically. \\nWhile abstract, we are able to more easily grasp \\nthis concept through the Ãyurvedic and allopath -\\nic paradigms.

For example, beautiful, aromatic flowers \\nlike roses, jasmine, and lavender, feed the senses \\nof sight and smell, bringing joy and peace to the \\npersonâs mind and body. Conversely, singing a \\nsweet song can calm another person or a pet.\\nA cool summer breeze feels good on the skin, \\nand a delicious meal brings contentment and joy. \\nFrom a universal vantage, we see the full moon \\ninfluences some peoplesâ emotions.\\nSo the senses can be seen like the permeable cell \\nmembranesâas a gatekeeper between the inner \\nand outer worlds. Now we will complete the link \\nbetween inner, gatekeeper, and the outer realms.\\nThe World as an Extension of the Body  \\nExternal Srotas\\nAs discussed, srotas are channels or systems \\nwhere information/nutrition flows, interacts, and \\ntransfers. The Vedic system from with Ãyurveda \\nis a part, states that all of lifeâfrom the sand peb -\\nbles to the farthest orbs in the universeâ are all a \\npart of oneself; the outer universe is nothing but \\nan extension or representation of oneâs inner self.Many theoretical physicists validate this notion \\nthat our preconceived ideas determine how we ex -\\nperience the world.\\nÃyurveda states that all of lifeâhumans, ani -\\nmals, and natureâhave a common underlying \\nrelationship: the 5 elements (ether, air, fire, wa -\\nter, and earth). Just as modern science say that \\nall things contain atoms and subatomic particles, \\nso Ãyurveda says all things are at their essence, \\ncomprised of the 5 elements.\\nThe Vedic mystical texts take this idea to its \\ncompletion; at their essence, all things in life are \\nthe same eternal, omnipresent Soul. Ãyurveda and \\nmodern science offer metaphors that help us bet -\\nter grasp this idea.  So we see how the world, the \\nsenses, and our internal bodies are all intimately \\nrelated.\\nAs Ãyurveda means, âthe wisdom of lifeâ, ot \\nconsiders the whole of oneâs life in the context of \\nhealth and harmony. From the point of view that \\nall of life is inter-connected, then we need to view \\nthe so-called âouterâ realms of ourselves within \\nthe framework of inner health and harmony.\\nTherefore, just as srotas connect internal sys -\\ntems, external srotas (e.g. social, environmental, \\neducational) are channels that more completely \\nand holistically connect all aspects of life that in -\\nfluence us.\\nFor example, if the pranavaha (respiratory) sro-\\ntas are blocked it can cause respiratory disorders, \\nand healed with herbal and breathing therapies. If \\nan asthmatic person only addresses their condi -\\ntion with herbs and prÃ¡`Ã¡yama (breathing exer -\\ncises), but ignores the environmental pollution in \\nthe building and air, they are only partially ad -\\ndressing their life and health.\\nLike this, when economic srotas are blocked, it \\nleads to financial inequity and is healed through \\nâfair tradeâ and âmicro-lendingâ therapies.

Seasonal factors : VÃ¡yu accumulates during \\nthe dry or dehydrating heat of the summer ( GrÃ­Ãh -\\nma: mid-May to mid-July). It becomes aggravated \\nduring the rainy season ( VarÃha : mid-July to mid-\\nSeptember), which causes weakened digestion, \\nacidic atmospheric conditions, and gas produced \\nfrom the earth.\\nPitta accumulates during the rainy season due \\nto the acidic conditions of the atmosphere and a \\nweakened digestion. It is aggravated during au -\\ntumn ( Â£harat : mid-  September to mid-Novem -ber) when the heat returns (perhaps equivalent \\nto Indian Summer). This occurs after the cooling \\nspell of the rainy season.\\nKapha accumulates during the cold season \\n(Â£hiÃ§hira : mid-January to mid-March) due to the \\ncold and damp caused by the winds, clouds, and \\nrain.

Obstructions are pro -\\nduced in the stomach and move through the upper \\nand lower tracts, producing diseases according to \\noneâs doÃha .\\nVÃ¡yu: Colic pain, constipation, malaise, dry \\nmouth, fainting, giddiness, irregular digestive \\npower, rigidity, hardening and contracting of ves -\\nsels.\\nPitta: Fever, diarrhea, internal burning sensa -\\ntion, thirst, intoxication, giddiness, and delirium.Kapha: V omiting, anorexia, indigestion, cold fe -\\nver, laziness, and heaviness.\\nDisease Development: Six Stages\\nEarlier, it was briefly mentioned that six stages \\nof disease development exist. However, modern \\nmedical technology can only see the last two stag -\\nes of any illness. Ãyurveda offers insight into the \\nearlier stages and enables those monitoring their \\nhealth to take care of any small imbalances well \\nbefore developing any serious illness. The six \\nstages of disease development are:\\n1. Accumulation : Illness begins in one of the \\nthree main doÃha sites: stomach (Kapha), small \\nintestine (Pitta), or the colon (VÃ¡yu). Excess \\nKapha in the stomach creates a blockage in the \\nsystem that leads to lassitude, heaviness, pallor, \\nbloating, and indigestion. Pitta accumulation cre -\\nates burning sensations, fever, hyperacidity, bitter \\ntaste in the mouth, and anger. The collecting of \\nVÃ¡yu creates gas, distention, constipation, dry -\\nness, fear, fatigue, insomnia, and the desire for \\nwarm things.\\nThe value of monitoring these experiences \\nwithin oneâs body and mind leads to the earliest \\ndetection of an imbalance, while it is still in its \\nhidden or incubatory stages.\\n2. Aggravation : As the imbalanced elements \\n(humors) continue to increase, the symptoms \\nmentioned above become more aggravated and \\nwill be noticed in other parts of the body as well. \\nKapha aggravation causes a loss of appetite, in -\\ndigestion, nausea, excess saliva, heaviness in the \\nheart and head, and oversleeping. The aggravated \\nPitta experience is one of increased acidity, burn -\\ning sensations in the abdomen, lowered vitality, \\nor insomnia. VÃ¡yu aggravation results in pain and \\nspasm in the abdomen, gas and rumbling in the \\nbowels, and light-headedness.\\n3. Overflow : Once the origin site is full with the \\nexcess humor (element), it will begin to overflow \\ninto the rest of the body using different channels of \\ntransportation.

During circulation the humors then be -\\ngin to seep into the organs, dhÃ¡tus (tissues), and \\nmalas (waste). Simultaneously, symptoms at the \\norigin site continue to grow worse.\\n4. Moving and localization at a distant site : The \\nhumors will move to wherever a weak site exists \\nin the body. This is where and when specific dis -\\neases begin to develop. For example, a VÃ¡yu ill -\\nness could move to the bones and begin to create \\narthritis. If the duodenum is weak, humors depos -\\nit themselves there and create an ulcer (usually \\na Pitta condition). Kapha moves to organs like \\nthe lungs when weakened. Healing is still simple,  \\neven at this fourth stage of illness.\\n5. Manifestation : This is the first stage of the \\ndevelopment of illness for which Western sci -\\nence can detect signs of disease. Here, diseases \\nbecome fully developed, showing signs of clini -\\ncal features. Names are given to imbalances of the \\nhumors, such as cancer, bronchitis, arthritis, etc.\\n6. Distinction/Chronic Complications : In this \\nlast stage, the symptoms become clear enough \\nso that the elemental cause may be determined. \\nFor example, VÃ¡yu asthma will cause dry skin, \\nconstipation, anxiety, attacks at dawn, and the de -\\nsiring of warmth. Pitta asthma will show yellow \\nphlegm, fever, sweating, and attacks at noon and \\nmidnight. Asthma brought on by Kapha will cre -\\nate white phlegm, water in the lungs, and attacks \\nduring the morning and evening.      Some prac -\\ntitioners describe this stage as the chronic phase \\nof development. For example, if one develops an \\ninflammation or abscess in stage five, in stage six, \\ncomplications set in, and the abscess may burst \\nand become a chronic ulcer.\\nThree Disease Pathways\\nIn our consideration of the Ãyurvedic view of \\nthe body, we also learn of the classification of \\nillness and the healing process through the three \\npaths that disease travels.\\nInner : This is the digestive tract involving dis -\\neases of the GI tract. These diseases are easy to heal because toxins are expelled through the tract. \\nDiseases of the inner path include fever, cough, \\nhiccups, enlarged abdomen or spleen, internal \\nedema, vomiting, and hard stools.\\nOuter : This path refers to the plasma/skin, blood, \\nand superficial tissues. Toxic blood and skin dis -\\neases are harder to heal because removing an ill -\\nness from the tissue is more difficult. Symptoms \\ninclude abdominal and other malignant tumors, \\nedema, and hemorrhoids.\\nCentral : This path refers to muscle, fat, bone, \\nmarrow, and deeper nerve tissues. This is the \\nmost delicate area of the body, affecting the heart, \\nhead, bone joints, and urinary bladder. The most \\ndifficult diseases develop here, such as cancer or \\narthritis. These diseases develop between the in -\\nner and outer paths.\\nSigns and Symptoms of Disease,   \\nby DoÃha\\nExcess VÃ¡yu : Drooping, dilation, loss of sensa -\\ntion, and weakness; continuous, cutting, pricking, \\ncrushing, or splitting pain; obstruction, contrac -\\ntion, or constriction; twisting, tingling, thirst, \\ntremors, roughness, dryness, throbbing, curva -\\ntures, gas, winding, stiffness, or rigidity; astrin -\\ngent taste in mouth, blue/crimson discoloration, \\npartial vacuums in bodily liquids.\\nExcess Pitta : Burning sensation, reddish dis -\\ncoloration, heat, high digestive fire, pus, ulcers, \\nperspiration, moistness, debility, fainting, toxic -\\nity, bitter and sour tastes in the mouth, oozing, \\nfungus.\\nExcess Kapha : Oiliness, hardness, itching irrita -\\ntions, cold, heaviness, obstructions, toxic or mu -\\ncus coatings inside the srotas (channels), loss of \\nmovement, swelling, edema, indigestion, exces -\\nsive sleep, whitish complexion, sweet and salty \\ntastes in the mouth.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Present life  (finding a specific cause of the \\nillness). These are healed with therapies of the op -\\nposite nature.\\n2. Past lives  (no apparent cause for an illness). \\nThese are healed after the action has worked itself \\nout.\\n3. A combination of both  (diseases that sud -\\ndenly manifest as terrible, profound and severe). \\nThese require a combination of therapies and the \\ncessation of harmful activities.\\nDiseases are either primary (initial symptoms) \\nor secondary (complications arising later). If the \\nsecondary complications of the doÃhas do not \\nsubside when the primary causes are healed, ad -\\nditional therapies must be administered.\\nAnalysis of Factors\\nFor healing to occur, the practitioner carefully \\nstudies and decides the condition of the vitiated \\ntissues ( dhÃ¡tus ) and wastes ( malas ), patientâs \\nhabitat, strength, and digestive power. He needs \\nto learn the constitution, age, mind, lifestyle, diet, \\nthe stage of the disease, and the season, before \\nrecommending the appropriate therapy. (Symp -\\ntoms may appear mild or severe, depending upon \\nthe patientâs total strength (mental and physical). \\nThus, the practitioner needs to make a careful and \\ncomplete analysis). \\nAfter determining individual body type and the \\nelemental cause and development of illness, the \\nnext step is to analyze the patientâs constitution \\nand illness ( prak^iti and vik^iti respectively). \\nThe DoÃhas -   \\nDeciding the Cause of Disease:\\n \\nGeneral Approach\\nThe practitioner has several methods of learning \\nthe prak^iti (constitution) and the vik^iti (illness) \\nof patients:1. Authoritative Instruction\\n2. Direct Observation\\n3. Inference\\n1. Authoritative Instruction  comes from a teach -\\ner who has had much experience in determining \\nthe cause and nature of constitutions and illness.\\n2. Observation  includes visual analysis of the \\nface, finger nails, eyes, tongue, urine, stool, com -\\nplexion, and shape; it also includes auditory ob -\\nservations of the tone of voice, listening for in -\\ntestinal gurgling, cracking sounds of bones and \\nfingers, coughing or hiccups, as well as by palpa -\\ntion, most notably the evaluation of the pulse.  By \\nnoticing certain characteristics, the practitioner \\nbegins to learn the doÃha or prak^iti (constitution) \\nand the doÃha imbalance that may be causing the \\nillness ( vik^iti ).\\nÃyurvedic observation is a threefold approach: \\nquestioning, observing, and palpating (touch). To \\ngain information that is not readily observable, \\nthe practitioner addresses questions directly to \\nthe patient and also asks the patient to complete a \\nquestionnaire or self-test (see appendix 2).\\nDiscussion with the patient helps reveal the \\nprak^iti and vik^iti . Discussing oneâs family and \\npersonal health history, and learning of the pa -\\ntientâs symptoms round out the consultation.\\nQuestionnaires are self-tests which ask a series \\nof mental and physical questions that help the \\npractitioner decide a personâs mental and physi -\\ncal doÃha and illness.\\n3.

When \\nthe pulse is also felt as wiry, hard, stiff, and fast, \\nthere are corresponding symptoms of Pitta asth -\\nma, rheumatism, gout, chronic headaches, and \\nbleeding disorders.\\nKapha pulses  are swan-like: regal, slow, and \\nconstant. Some people say it is a warm pulse, \\nwhile others say it is cold. Related symptoms are \\ncoughing, melancholy, constipation, bronchial \\ndisorders, and overweight.\\nVÃ¡yu/Pitta pulses  alternate between snake and \\nfrog qualities. The pulse feels knotty, restless, in -\\ntermittent, imperceptible, thick, and thin. Health \\nissues include thirst, vertigo, headaches, sup -\\npressed urine, extremity pain, and heat.\\nPitta/VÃ¡yu pulses  feel jumpy and hard, with heat \\nand blood related symptoms being predominant.\\nVÃ¡yu/Kapha pulses  alternate between snake and \\nswan qualities, weak and forceful, vanishing, hol -\\nlow, slippery, and irregular qualities. Symptoms \\ninclude chills, extremity pain, frequent urination, cough, insomnia, drowsiness, feeling slow and \\nfast, soft and expanded. Sometimes chronic com -\\nplaints arise around the new and full moon.\\nKapha/VÃ¡yu pulses  feel soft and slow.\\nPitta/Kapha pulses  alternate between frog and \\nswan qualities, with symptoms of both fire and \\nwater excesses. Pitta concerns are more aggra -\\nvated.\\nKapha/Pitta pulses  alternate between swan and \\nfrog qualities, with predominantly Kapha symp -\\ntoms, and secondary Pitta complaints.\\nTridoÃhic (all three doÃhas) pulses  will show \\nall three qualities: snake, frog, and swan. Pulse \\nmovements are periodic, quick, jumpy, and slow.\\nHealthy pulse  has no signs of dullness. In the \\nmorning the pulse feels cool and steady, at noon it \\nfeels warm. The pulse moves quickly in the eve -\\nning. These three pulses indicate the person has \\nbeen healthy for a long while and will continue to \\nbe healthy for some time to come.\\nPulse-DoÃha Detection\\nOne method is to lightly place fingers on the \\npulse positions until a pulse is first felt under one \\nfinger. If the pulse if first noticed under the index \\nfinger, this shows a VÃ¡yu doÃha (before 10 a.m.) \\nor VÃ¡yu imbalance (after 10 a.m.). The middle \\nfinger suggests a Pitta doÃha or Pitta imbalance. \\nA Kapha doÃha pulse is first felt under the ring \\nfinger. Sometimes this method is inaccurate be -\\ncause of the pulse being more easily felt closer to \\nthe wrist.\\nSome practitioners believe that whichever fin -\\nger the pulse is first felt (i.e., index/VÃ¡yu, mid -\\ndle/Pitta, ring/Kapha) will tell whether an illness \\nis located in a VÃ¡yu, Pitta, or Kapha organ (or \\nthe prak^iti before 10 a.m.). Should the pulse be \\nfelt under two fingers simultaneously, then both \\ndoÃhas are imbalanced (or a dual- doÃ¤ha prak^iti \\nbefore 10 a.m.). Sometimes one may feel the \\npulse under one or two fingers strongly and yet \\nfeel a mild pulse under the second or third finger.

The practitioner investigates âthe cause of \\nthe cause.â For example, if a person wants to lose \\nweight, therapy can begin in one of three ways. \\nFirst, one may address the symptom with al -\\nlopathic weight loss pills. Obviously, this is the \\nmost superficial method. Second, one may realize \\nthat the cause of the weight is a Kapha tendency \\nand follow appropriate Kapha-reduction thera -\\npies. Yet, a deeper level still exists. What is the \\ncause of the overeating? Perhaps it is an VÃ¡yu-\\nimbalanced mind, producing worry or anxiety. \\nKapha imbalances create a need for love and con -\\ntentment. These factors may cause a person to eat \\nmore. Therapies include herbs and foods to re -\\nduce weight, calm the mind, and culture the heart. \\nSÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation) is also advised to develop \\ninner calm and Self-love.\\nWhen viewing weight gain from another van -\\ntage point, finding out what causes anxiety in the \\nperson may uncover dharmic (life-purpose), ka-\\nmic (spiritual relationship), or spiritual situations, \\nthat are making the person unhappy.\\nThe dharmic reasons are easily discovered \\nwhen asking patients if they love the career in \\nwhich they are presently working. They specifi -\\ncally need to say they love it. When they acknowl -\\nedge that they do, the practitioner can focus more \\ndeeply into kama and mokÃha (Self-Realization) \\nquestioning.\\nIf they admit they are unhappy with their ca -\\nreers, a deeper question is asked; âWhat is it you \\nwould love to do if you could, regardless whether \\nit seems possible or practical?â  Often patients re -\\nalize that once, before they stopped doing some -\\nthing they loved, they did not have a weight prob -\\nlem; only after they stopped doing what they love \\n(e.g., teaching dancing) did the weight gain occur. \\nThus, the practitioner uncovers the ultimate cause \\nof the weight problem. People doing what they \\nlove to do find their lives are transformed in a very \\nshort time.\\nSpiritual lacking is yet another dimension that \\nmay cause overeating and overweight. It is the \\ncause of all causes of diseases. An inner lack of fulfillment may exist in oneâs career, relationship \\nor in their self worth. These persons are urged to \\nbegin taking small steps towards involving them -\\nselves in whatever they need for inner nourish -\\nment. These three topics will be discussed in de -\\ntail later in the book.\\nSo we see that the discussion portion of the con -\\nsultation covers mind, body, career, relationships, \\nand spirituality. This makes for a truly holistic in -\\nvestigation.\\nSuggested Reading\\nAmber, B.B. Pulse Diagnosis . Santa Fe, NM: \\nAurora Press; 1993.\\nLad, V .

Their action is stron -\\ngest when they are fresh, but they may also be \\nused as decoctions, infusions, teas, powders, and \\npills. Pills have the least power, but retain their \\npotency the longest. Below are some of the most \\ncommonly used Ãyurvedic herbs available in \\nAmerica today.\\nHerbs are classified according to which doÃha \\nthey decrease and increase. Decreasing a doÃha \\nis useful for a person of that body type, while an \\nherb that increases oneâs doÃha will aggravate it. \\nFor example, a VÃ¡yu person will be helped by \\nginger, a warm herb, but be irritated by golden -\\nseal, a dry, bitter herb. \\nThis is yet another reason the Ãyurvedic para -\\ndigm is so extraordinary. This personalizing as -\\npect of Ãyurveda can be integrated into all other \\nhealing systems. Here we will see an example of \\nthis by classifying some Western herbs according \\nto the Ãyurvedic framework.\\nÃyurveda uses herbs according to their energies \\nor âenergetics.â The same five unique classifica -\\ntions discussed under nutrition in the last chapter \\nalso apply to herbs. Each herb has its own thera -\\npeutic effects.     1. Initial taste\\n     2. Element\\n     3. Hot or cold effect\\n     4. Post digestion effect\\n     5. Special properties\\nTaste is considered therapeutic for several rea -\\nsons. The Sanskrit word for taste is rasa. It means \\ndelight or essence, both of which are healing. If \\nthe taste of the food is not pleasing, the gastric \\nfires may not digest the food, and thus proper \\nnutrition is not received. That is why Ãyurvedic \\ncooking is a science unto itself, blending the \\nright amount of herbs for the right taste. In our \\nsociety, we have confused our sense of taste with \\nunwholesome (artificial) objects of food, thereby \\ncreating disease.\\nThe Six Tastes\\nAccording to Ãyurveda, all foods and liquids \\ncontain six tastes: sweet, salty, sour, pungent, bit -\\nter, astringent, or combinations. As discussed in \\nthe previous chapter, each of the six tastes either \\nincrease, or decrease, each doÃha . To review; \\nSweet : Reduces VÃ¡yu and Pitta and increases    \\n     Kapha\\nSour : Reduces VÃ¡yu and increases Pitta and  \\n     Kapha\\nSalty : Reduces VÃ¡yu and increases Pitta and \\n     Kapha\\nPungent : Reduces Kapha and increases Pitta  \\n     and VÃ¡yuChapter 4\\nHerbology', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

From this point of view, \\nit doesnât make sense to struggle unnaturally to \\nearn to buy things when we can get what we need \\nfrom life with only natural effort. \\nAn example of this is planting one marigold \\nseed; it yields over 100 flowers in a 5-6 month \\nseason, and each flower, upon dying, yields hun -\\ndreds of seeds. Do one nice thing for Mother Na -\\nture and she gives back thousand-fold. Another \\nexample of abundance is birds, who always find \\nfood and shelter without having to âworking over -\\ntimeâ. \\nAbundance can be found in human foods also; \\nthere is enough of what we need in nature if we \\neat natural, whole, fresh foods. Moreover, there \\nis an abundance of healing medicine within the \\nfoods we eat to heal a majority of chronic health \\nconditionsâor at least âhealthy, timely eating \\nhabits improve oneâs sense of general well being.\\nThere is an expression, âyou are what you eatâ. \\nIf you heat healthy, whole, fresh, organic foods, 2-\\n3 meals a day, you will be healthy, whole, and full \\nof life. Many research studies are finding that the \\nvitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc. in our foods \\nprevent and heal diseases from colds to cancers.\\nWe can add to the above maxim and say, âyou \\nthink what you eatâ. Research in the field of Nu -\\ntritional Psychology has found that the foods we \\neat affect the chemical processing of the mind as \\nwell. In her book, Food & Behavior , the author re -\\nports case studies that found when junk food was \\nreplaced with whole foods, teens in trouble with \\nthe law became law-abiding citizens, and regular \\nstudents who ate whole foods found their behav -\\nior and grades to improve. \\nOne key example is white sugar (as opposed to whole cane sugar). The body makes glucose from \\ncarbohydrates in our food. Glucose (blood sug -\\nar) is what builds our brain cells. Certain foods \\ncontain either simple or complex carbohydrates. \\nWhole grains and fresh fruit (i.e., fiberous) are \\ncomplex carbohydrates, taking time to digest and \\nthereby enter the bloodstream slowly. White sug -\\nar is a simple carbohydrate, instantly entering the \\nbloodstream. The body is shocked by this sudden \\nrise in glucose and instantly responds by produc -\\ning excess insulin to remove the excess glucose \\nfrom the bloodstream. The glucose is removed \\nto the point deficiency. This drop in blood sugar \\ncauses the area of the brain called the cerebrum \\n(responsible for thought, learning, moral and so -\\ncial behavior) to shut down to allow the bodyâs \\nremaining energy to control the basic or primitive \\nfunctions (drives for food, sex, aggression/de -\\nfense, etc.). \\nMany psychological disorders such as some \\nforms of ADD/ADHD, depression, and aberrant \\nbehavior are misdiagnosed; some of these condi -\\ntions have been found to be healed through simply \\nchanging to whole foods. The inter-relationship \\nbetween food and behavior is quite astonishing, \\nand the good news is that this simple change in \\nfood behaviors requires no purchasing of drugs, \\nvitamins, or herbs, and at the very least, improves \\nthe quality of life. Nature does give to us in abun -\\ndance if we choose wisely.\\nTo return to the main theme of this book, Ãy -\\nurveda is a wisdom of life. It reveals natural pat -\\nterns that allow us to live a full, vibrant life. So  \\nwhile we have discussed foods as they benefit \\nphysical and mental health, it is best to see meals \\nin its whole life contextâanother of lifeâs gifts. \\nÃyurveda says, how we behave and what we think \\nwhile eating affects the foodâs energy-nutrition in \\nthe body and mind.

So how we think while \\neating is as important as what we eat; it is best to  \\nkeep our minds on our life-vision, our purpose on \\nthis earth, positive emotions, and feeling gratitude \\nfor all we have in life. This is called spiritual nu -\\ntritionâframe of mind affects nutrition at least as \\nmuch the quality of the food.\\nFood for Body & Mind\\nWith an understanding of spiritual nutrition, let \\nus now consider the properties of foods. We have \\nbriefly touched upon the topic of tastes, as they are \\nrelated to the seasons. This may be quite an un -\\nusual way to look at the seasons, but nonetheless, \\na useful one when considering health. To better \\nunderstand the idea of taste from the Ãyurvedic \\nviewpoint, we need to examine it in depth. Its in -\\nsights explain the role of tastes in healing. Unique \\nto Ãyurveda is a scientific breakdown of tastes, \\ndiscussed according to energiesâor energetics. \\nÃyurveda classifies herbs, foods, and drinks into \\nfive aspects. Each has its own therapeutic effects;\\n1. Taste\\n2. Element (property)\\n3. Hot or cold effect\\n4. Post-digestion effect (final taste after diges -\\ntion)\\n5. Special properties\\nTaste : It is considered therapeutic for several \\nreasons. The Sanskrit word for taste is âRasaâ . \\nIt means delight or essence, both of which pro -\\nmote healing. A channel extends from the mouth \\ninto the head and brings the essence (one mean -\\ning of taste) to the brain. This essence stimulates \\nprÃ¡Ã²a , which in turn stimulates the agni or diges -\\ntive fires. If the taste of the food is not pleasing, \\nthe gastric fires may not digest the food and thus \\ndo not provide proper nutrition. That is why Ãy -\\nurvedic cooking is a science unto itself, blending \\nthe right amount of herbs for the right taste. In our society, we have adulterated our sense of taste \\nwith unwholesome (artificial) foods (one of the \\ntwo fundamental causes of disease we discussed \\nin volume one).\\nElement: Six tastes originate from the five ele -\\nments, transmitting their properties: sweet, salty, \\nsour, pungent, bitter, astringent. All tastes essen -\\ntially originate in the water element, having their \\norigin here. No food consists only of one taste; \\nall five elements are contained in all substances. \\nSo when it is said that a food has a certain taste \\n(e.g., sweet), that taste predominates. Similarly, \\nno illness is caused by purely one doÃha. How -\\never, when a doÃha predominates, it is said that an \\nillness is caused by that specific doÃha.\\nTaste Element Food\\nsweet earth/wa -\\ntersugar, starches\\nsour earth/fire fermented, acids\\nsalty water/fire salt, alkaline\\npungent fire/air spicy, acrid, aro -\\nmatic\\nbitter ether/air herbs\\nastrin -\\ngentearth/air* constricting quality \\nwith tannin\\nAll persons need some for each of the six tastes \\nin their diet. However, depending on oneâs consti -\\ntution and the season, one will adjust their tastes \\nto balance their doÃha . The key is to have a mod -\\nerate amount of each taste. The benefits listed be -\\nlow result from ingesting foods that develop these \\nhealing measures. However, they relate primarily \\nto the doÃha (s) listed.

Pitta is balanced by using sweet (moist), \\nbitter, and astringent (cooling) tastes. This helps \\ncounter heat-related illness (e.g., infection, rash, \\nanger, impatience). Kapha diseases are removed \\nby using sour and pungent tastes (i.e., they heat \\nand burn up water). Bitter tastes also reduce Ka -\\npha by causing a drying action.\\nSweet : Generally, food is sweet in taste, neutral \\nin energy, and sweet in its post-digestive effect. It \\ndecreases VÃ¡yu and Pitta, and increases Kapha. \\nIt nourishes and maintains humors, dhÃ¡tus , and \\nmalas (wastes).\\nSour : Examples of sour tastes include sour fruit, \\ntomatoes, and pickled vegetables. All  tissues are \\nnourished by sour tastes, except reproductive tis -\\nsue (of the sour tastes, only yogurt nourishes all \\ntissues).\\nSalty : Seafood or condiment. In moderation, \\nsalt strengthens all tissues.

Spices can \\nmake foods lighter. Oils can make them heavi -\\ner. Foods are also dry or moist. Dryness can be \\nincreased by eating dry foods or toast, or made \\nmore moist by frying foods or adding liquids.\\nSpecial Properties: (PrabhÃ¡va)\\nHerbs also have some subtler, more specific \\nqualities, beyond their traditional rules and defi -\\nnitions. For example, basil, although a heating \\nherb, reduces fever. Herbs with similar energies \\nwill have different special properties. \\nCertain external actions affect the herbâs prab-\\nhÃ¡va : mantras , gems, yantras , or just the inten -\\ntion or love imparted by the practitioner alters the \\nherbs beyond the general classifications. For ex -\\nample, Ã¡malakÃ­ (embellica officinalis ) and barhal \\n(a variety of ficus bengalensis, linn .) both have \\nsame taste, property, energy, and final taste after \\ndigestion. Yet Ã¡malakÃ­ alleviates the doÃhas and \\nbarhal aggravates the doÃhas . Also til (sesame \\nseeds) and madan (randia dumetorum, lamk .) \\nhave predominant sweet, astringent, and bitter  \\ntastes. Both are oily and sticky. Yet, madan is an \\nemetic, sesame is not. Similarly, wearing specific \\nstones like topaz, ruby, sapphire etc., can heal dif -\\nferent diseases.\\nDual DoÃhas\\nIt is simple mathematics. When doÃhas are not \\nin a balanced state, either you must increase the \\ndepleted doÃha or decrease the aggravated doÃha . \\nWhen a person has a dual doÃha (e.g., VÃ¡yu/Pitta) \\nthey are advised to ingest foods and herbs that in -\\ncrease the third or deficient element (e.g., Kapha). \\nSimultaneously, one reduces their intake of foods \\nand herbs that increase the two excessive doÃhas \\n(e.g., VÃ¡yu and Pitta). \\nFoods affect the surface nutrition, while herbs \\naid the subtle nutrition. There also may be in -\\nstances when one doÃha is greatly in excess, and \\na second mildly aggravated. Thus, proper  consid -\\neration of degree of derangement is necessary as \\nwell.Tastes and Organs\\nEach of the six tastes also produces effects on \\neach of the internal organs as well. Again, through \\ningesting the proper tastes, the health of the or -\\ngans may be maintained.\\nPhysiology of the 6 Tastes\\nÃyurveda says that each taste, in excess, will \\nadversely affect certain organs in the body. This is \\nused as a cross-reference to the five-element view \\nof health and balance, stated earlier.\\nTaste Organ\\nsweet spleen (pancreas)\\nsour liver\\nsalty kidneys\\npungent lungs\\nbitter heart\\nastringent colon\\nTaste Organ\\nThus, Ãyurveda offers a unique view of the \\nenergetics of taste: six tastes (the initial taste, its \\nhot or cold energy, and its aftertaste), how tastes \\nare related to doÃhas , organs, diseases, and emo -\\ntions, and their special properties. It is a complete \\nscience of mechanics and energies. Further, it \\nreveals a causal relationship between food and \\nhealth; how one feels is greatly decided by what \\none eats. \\nAs discussed earlier, Ãyurveda aims to remove \\nthe cause of an illness. Rather than âcuringâ a spe -\\ncific disease, this science addresses the balance of \\nthe whole individual. Along with external causes \\nit always considers the two levels of health: body \\nand mind. In the last chapter, we discussed how \\nthe tastes and energies of foods play a direct role \\nin creating health or illness, from the Ãyurvedic \\npoint of view.\\nLife habits (external) measures are also consid -\\nered another essential Ãyurvedic healing measure, \\nwhen lifestyle changes are gradually adapted. In \\nthe original Ãyurvedic texts, people are cautioned \\nnot to start or stop habits too suddenly.

We \\nfind similar wisdom in the spiritual texts about \\nthe transition points at sunrise, noon, sunset, and \\nmidnight. It is suggested that these are points of \\nweakness; the person is better advised to spend \\nthese transitional times in sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation).\\nEven for a healing science that suggests vegetar -\\nianism to those who are healthy, Ãyurveda does \\nnot advise giving up meat cold-turkey (no pun in -\\ntended). Even if a food is bad for oneâs constitu -\\ntion (e.g., oneâs favorite vegetables or desserts), \\nor good for their doÃha , gradual stopping/starting \\nof any habits is advised. Gentleness is the key. \\nSimilarly, if one undertakes too radically a de -\\ntoxification program, one may experience bodily \\ndiscomforts from conditions such as diarrhea or \\nexcess toxins. Ãyurveda has the unique position \\nof offering a healing process that does not have to \\nmake one feel bad before feeling better. \\nHealing is approached in that sense. It will make \\nlife better, simpler, and more natural, enhancing \\nspiritual growth as well. It may take some months \\nbefore the effects of healing are manifested. Mak -\\ning one or two changes for health, and consistent -\\nly following them, is better than experimenting \\nhere and there without a foundation for growth \\nand healing. The Ãyurvedic motto is, âno painâ\\nno painâ.\\nAlso, people often look for quick, healing, \\nmagic-medicine that allows them to return to their \\nself-harming (bad habits) ways. In fact, illness is \\na sign that life is not being lived in balance. Herbs \\nare a food supplement and not magic pills that \\ninstantly remove discomfort. Some people may \\nbe impatient with this âgradualâ lifestyle develop -\\nment, but it is an enhancement of lifestyle and not \\na quick cure that Ãyurveda achieves.\\nChronic indigestion also requires slow change. \\nOne week of kicharÃ­ (rice and beans may be need -\\ned for those with severe conditions.

However, when food is overcooked, \\nits life force becomes depleted. Further, cooking \\nwith too much heavy oil can weaken the digestive \\nfire. Food is best eaten when cooked or steamed \\nrather than uncooked; it is more nutritive and \\nbuilding. Also, persons on spiritual paths, (i.e., \\npracticing sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation) and following a \\nguru or spiritual guide), generally need not follow \\nsuch drastic raw-food measures. Eating raw food \\ncauses roughness among persons on the spiritual \\npath. It is true that raw foods have enzymes to re -\\nmove toxins, but they do not adequately build the \\ntissues. Fruit is better fresh and uncooked. Micro -\\nwaves damage the life-force. Restaurant food is \\ngenerally over- or under- spiced, and not as good \\nas a home-cooked meal. Cooking over a wood \\nfire is best. Cooking on a gas stove is better than \\ncooking on an electric stove. \\nQuality Sattwic : organic, fresh, homegrown, \\nfresh-picked, and raw dairy foods are advised.

Food, when \\neaten, should fill one-third of the stomach size \\nor capacity. Liquid, when taken after meals, also \\nshould fill one-third the stomach size. The time \\nto drink liquids at mealtime varies with the indi -\\nvidual. Heavy or obese persons should drink be -\\nfore meals. Underweight or thin persons should \\ndrink liquids after meals, and persons of normal \\nweight should drink with their meals. The remain -\\ning one-third of space in the stomach helps diges -\\ntion. The key is moderation and regularity. VÃ¡yu \\ndoÃhas need to eat every 3 - 4 hours. Pitta persons \\ngenerally have good digestive fire. Kapha consti -\\ntutions need to eat less. Ultimately, the stronger \\nthe digestive fire, the more one can eat. (Less food \\nis better with a fever. \\nWhen Hungry Eat only after the previous meal \\nhas been digested. Otherwise, the digestive prod -\\nuct of the previous meal becomes mixed with the \\nnew food, instantly aggravating all the doÃhas . \\nThe digestive fire/enzymes have to act upon the \\nfood for some time in order to digest the food. \\nThen, the body needs time to restore the digestive \\nfire/enzymes for the future. If a person takes food \\nbefore digesting the previous meal completely, the \\nfood will not digest properly. The undigested food \\nis pushed along the GI tract by normal peristalsis, \\nimbalancing and aggravating the doÃ¤has .\\nCombinations Combining vegetables with fruit \\nor milk can cause digestive problems. One needs \\nto be careful while eating or choosing food. Dif -\\nferent combinations may be harmful. Its not ad -\\nvised to combine sour tastes with milk, eat cold \\nitems after ghee , eat equal amounts of ghee and \\nhoney, or eat fish products along with dairy (these \\nunhealthy combinations create subtle toxins). Oth -\\ner aggravating foods are too hot and too cold, or \\ntoo light and too heavy. Stew and curry are more \\ndigestible than individual vegetables cooked and \\neaten separately. \\n  VÃ¡yuâ the fewer combinations the bet -\\nter (they like combining foods, though it \\nis not good for them).\\n  Pittaâ does best with combinations\\n   Kaphaâ is between VÃ¡yu and Pitta.\\nSpices Delicious tastes improve digestion, \\nstrength, senses, complexion, and a healthy \\nweight. They are easily digested and help ApÃ¡na \\nVÃ¡yu. The use of spices stimulates the secretions \\nof digestive enzymes. Over-salted, under-salted, \\nor sour seasoning is to be avoided. Foods that are \\ntoo tasty increase rajas (aggravating the blood). \\nFoods that are too bland cause tamas (suppress -\\ning agni).\\nVÃ¡yuâdoes well with rich and moder -\\nately strong spices.\\nPittaâneeds only mild spices.\\nKaphaâdoes best with light, strongly \\nspiced foods.\\nFrame of Mind A relaxed, calm mind promotes \\neasy assimilation of food. This makes the mind \\nmore sattwic . A nervous, anxious, angry, noisy, \\nand rushed mind makes the food harder to digest. \\nSmoky environments are also harmful when eat -\\ning. \\nSilence is good, but there is no need to be too \\nserious. A prayer of gratitude to the Creator and \\nSupplier before a meal, or offering the food to \\nbenefit humanity and the creation of beings is ad -\\nvised.

Eat foods and herbs according to \\ngeography (do not eat hot and dry items in a hot \\ndry desert, or cold and oily items in cold and damp \\nclimates).\\nMiscellaneous Do not ingest equal amounts \\nof ghee and honey simultaneously (it becomes \\na subtle toxin). Do not break with eating habits \\n(e.g., someone who generally eats cold and sweet \\nthings should not suddenly start eating hot and \\npungent items). Herbs, diet, and lifestyle are rec -\\nommended to balance the doÃha , but also should \\nbe in harmony with oneâs own habits. Intake of \\nsubstances that aggravate the doÃha and state of \\noneâs strength is ill advised. Eat after clearing the \\nbowel and urinary bladder, and only when hun -\\ngry. \\nDrinking (except lassi buttermilk [yogurt and \\nwater], and medicated herbal wine to stimulate \\ndigestion) is not recommended during the meal, \\nbut is all right afterwards.  Drinking alcohol after \\nmeals causes hyperacidity unless it is medicated \\nherbal wines for VÃ¡yu and Kapha. Astringent or \\nherbal teas are all right after meals, but coffee \\npromotes indigestion, hyperacidity, or ulcers.\\nDesserts (especially cold) are heavy and sweet, \\nand suppress digestive fire, causing fermentation \\nand indigestion. They are better before meals, as \\nsweets are the first taste to be digested. Having \\nraw foods and salads at the end of the meal is \\nbetter for digestion. Other authorities say a little \\nsweet after meals promotes digestion.\\nAge/Gender these characteristics may bring \\nexcess to oneâs doÃ¤ha . Therefore, reduction of \\ndoÃhas may need to be considered at different \\nages, and for different genders.\\nKapha reduction is predominantly used from \\nbirth to age 15, and for women. Pitta reduction \\nis primarily from age 15 to 55 years old, and for \\nmen. VÃ¡yu reduction occurs at age 55 and over.\\nÃma: For 1 or 2 weeks, spices and a light and cleansing diet are followed. Spices are given to \\ndigest the undigested food or Ã¡ma and cleanse \\nthe entire body. Sugars, oils, meat, and dairy are \\navoided. Then, one returns to their doÃha diet, \\nstaying on the light side until Ã¡ma is completely \\ngone. Different books offer varying doÃha food \\nlists. Ultimately, persons will have to decide \\nwhether any specific food is good or aggravating \\ntheir doÃ¤ha .\\nVegetarianism:   \\nProteins, Vitamins, and Minerals \\nEach year more and more people decide to be -\\ncome vegetarians. Yet the major question asked at \\nour center is how one gets enough protein, vita -\\nmins, and minerals in their diet. \\nIt is true that active people who follow a vegetar -\\nian diet need sufficient amounts of these nutrients. \\nProteins are best derived from milk, yogurt, and \\nhigh-protein content beans like garbanzos ( chan -\\nna dal ) and tur dal (both found in Indian grocer -\\nies). They can be mixed with mÃºngdal , which also \\nhas high protein content, but not as much as the \\nother two beans. Boiled milk can be taken once \\nor twice a day. Yogurt/ water ( lassi) can be taken \\nonce or twice a day between 10 a.m. and sunset. \\nBeans can be mixed together and eaten for lunch \\nand dinner.\\nFor an ample supply of vitamins and minerals, \\na mixture of green leafy vegetables, root vegeta -\\nbles, and colored vegetables (e.g., eggplant, yel -\\nlow squash) need to be eaten daily. The amount of \\nvegetables must be increased as well. \\nWhen all the beans and vegetables (each benefi -\\ncial for various doÃhas ) are eaten together in one \\nmeal, their properties balance, without aggravate \\nany one doÃha . However, when a doÃha is severe -\\nly unbalanced, certain foods may be required in \\nsmaller quantitiesâor not at allâuntil balance is \\nrestored.\\nFoods When no Sanskrit name exists and a \\nHindi name is available, it will be marked with \\nan âHâ. V , P , and K stand for VÃ¡yu, Pitta, and Ka -\\npha respectively. Various books offer differing en -\\nergetics for certain foods. In fact, the same food \\ngrown in different locations may develop different \\nenergetics.

PaÃ±cha Karma permanently elimi -\\nnates these toxins from the body, allowing healing \\nand restoration of the tissues, channels, digestion, \\nand mental functions.\\nSix therapies are divided into two categories: 1) \\nToning or nourishing (b^iÂµhaÃ²a or saÂµtarpaÃ²a), \\nand 2) Reducing or detoxifying (laÂ´ghana \\nor apartarpaÃ²a )âthose  that cause lightness.  \\n \\n B^iÃ¥haÃ²a                        LaÂ´ghana   \\n(earth, water)\\n \\n(ether, air, fire)\\nSnehana       RÃºkÃhaÃ²a               Svedhana          Stambhana \\n(oil therapy)   (drying) \\n \\n          (sweating)       (astringent)  \\n AnuvÃ¡sana     \\n      Basti           FIGURE 1\\nB^iÂµhaÃ²a tones because it uses therapies that \\npromote earth and water elements, while laÂ´ghana \\nlightens by using ether, air, and fire elements to \\nreduce. Illness is relieved as doÃ¤has become bal -\\nanced through these therapies.\\nThe six major therapeutic categories are either \\ntoning or reducing in nature. \\n1. Reducing (laÂ´ghana or lightening) the body, \\nmaking it light.\\n2. Nourishing (b^iÂµhaÃ²a or expanding) the \\nbody by adding corpulence.\\n3. Drying (rÃºkÃhaÃ²a) or producing roughness in \\nthe body.\\n4. Oleation (snehana) or applying oil to the \\nbody creates softness, fluidity, and moistness.\\n5. Sudation (svedhana) or sweating, removes \\nstiffness, heaviness, and coldness. 6.

These measures are also used for stiff \\nthighs, skin diseases, herpes, abscesses, spleen, \\nhead, throat and eye problems; and are provided \\nto people during the cold season (Â£hiÂ¤hiraâ mid \\nJan. to mid March).\\nPitta and Kapha disorders follow Â¤hodhana \\n(strong) therapies of purgation and emesis. Symp -\\ntoms include the presence of toxins, obesity, fe -\\nver, vomiting or nausea, diarrhea, heart disease, \\nconstipation, heaviness, and excess belching.\\nPeople with moderate symptoms of weight \\ngain and medium strength are first given diges -\\ntive herbs like ginger, cardamom, or cinnamon. \\nPersons who need to boost their appetites are also \\ngiven hunger-producing herbs like bibhÃ­takÃ­ and \\nguggul.

Kaphas also need nourishing therapies \\nfor the ether, air, and fire elements of VÃ¡yu and \\nPitta. In fact, each doÃha may need some form of \\ndetoxification, depending upon its condition.\\nIt is a unique insight of the Ãyurvedic system \\nthat healing requires a removal of the toxins \\nthrough one of the various reduction therapies.\\nThen a nurturing therapy to build healthy new cells and tissues follows. To nourish before detox -\\nifying would be adding to the preexisting toxins. \\nIn other words, nourishing therapies would only \\nnourish the toxic condition.

Colors/Environment/Meals\\nFresh air, wind, and sun help stimulate diges -\\ntion in mild cases of illness. While color therapy \\nis not technically a consideration of saÃ¥Â¤hamana, \\nit is incorporated here for additional therapeutic \\nvalue. Colors work more on the mind than the \\nbody, so they help balance psychological causes \\nof illness.\\nVÃ¡yuâbalancing therapies include short fasts \\n(1 to 3 days), being warm and comfortable inside \\nand outside the home, moist air (for one living in \\na dry climate), and mild sunbathing. Wear warm \\ncolors of red, orange, and gold. White (a moist \\ncolor) also balances mild VÃ¡yu excesses. The bed \\nshould be soft and comfortable. The environment \\nshould be pleasing. One must adopt measures for \\nself-care.\\nPittaâmild fasts (about one week), air and wind bathing reduce excess heat. Cool-colored clothing \\n(i.e., white and pale shades of green, pink, and \\nblue) are also balancing.\\nKaphaâsunbathing, fresh air, long fasts, warm \\ncolor therapyâred, orange, yellow in clothes, fur -\\nniture, and decorâin both home and officeâbal -\\nances excess Kapha.\\n9. Lifestyle\\nVÃ¡yuâresting the body and mind. Excess trav -\\neling, noise, distractions are avoided, sleeping \\nduring the day, if tired, and having a secure and \\nstable lifestyleâwith happiness, contentment and \\njoyâis suggested. Mild exercise (stop when per -\\nspiration begins) is useful.\\nPittaâcool, pleasing environments, cool breez -\\nes, moonlight, avoiding sun, heat, and fire. Relax -\\nation is advised, doing various or diverse things, \\nallowing time for amusement and play, practicing \\nsweet, affectionate, loving, friendly behavior; be -\\ning near water and gardens. Conflict, arguments, \\naggression, ambition, strain, and overwork, and \\neffort are avoided. Moderate exercise is useful \\n(stop when perspiration begins).\\nKaphaâdry, rough clothes and environment \\n(i.e., austere lifeâsleeping on the floor, physi -\\ncal labor, staying up late at night, not napping or \\nsleeping late), avoiding cold and damp; and being \\nin hot, dry, sunny, fiery, and warm breezy places. \\nThis is a time one when breaks attachments and \\nhabitsâgiving up the past (mentally) and posses -\\nsions.

First, through pal -\\nliation and purification, one loosens toxins lodged \\nin the body. This allows the toxins to return \\nthrough the bloodstream to their origin sites in the \\ngastrointestinal tract. Once there, the toxins can be \\ncompletely expelled from the body through five \\nmethods known as paÃ±cha karma. PaÃ±cha karma \\n(five actions) actually includes three stages (see \\ntable below).\\n \\nTherapy Description  \\n1. Preliminary (palliative)  employing oil and \\nsweating methods (snehana and svedhana ). [of-\\nten used throughout the year as a general mainte -\\nnance and preventive program]\\n2. Primary purificatory practices( paÃ±cha kar -\\nma) uses emesis, purgation, enemas, nasal \\ntherapy.\\n3. Post PK therapies\\n \\nrejuvenation and tonifica -\\ntion.\\n  \\nOil Therapy (Snehana)\\nUsing oils, both internally and externally,  \\nis a very important Ãyurvedic therapy\\nWarm, medicinal oils are applied in large \\namounts all over the body. Some practitioners use \\nsesame oil for all three constitutions. Others use \\nmedicated oils like mahÃ¡nÃ¡rÃ¡yan oil. Still others \\nuse medicated oils in specific body sites, such as \\non the chakras and marma points, or at specific \\ntrouble spots. Essential oils may also be employed \\naccording to the doÃhas. It is the use of the oil \\nthat is important, and not the massage technique \\nor training. (Actually, a professional massage pro -\\nduces the same effects as snehana and svedhana). \\nSpecific Ãyurvedic massage-like techniques (ab-\\nhyaÃ±ga) will be discussed later. Along with the \\napplication of oil, intake of oil or ghee (snehapÃ¡ -na) is also recommended. Sesame oil or ghee is \\nused for VÃ¡yu, sunflower or ghee for Pitta, and \\nmustard, canola, or flax seed oils for Kapha.\\nOil Uses:  Oils help loosen and liquefy toxins and \\nhumors in the skin and blood (called the outer \\ndisease pathway), dislodging and removing the \\nheavy, sticky toxins from the smallest channels. \\nThus, toxins begin to drain from the central dis -\\nease pathway (deeper tissues) and start to flow \\ninto the GI tract. Secretions are also activated, \\nenabling easier doÃ¤ha transport of toxins (Ã¡ma) \\nand wastes (malas) as they return to the GI tract \\nfor elimination. Oil lubricates and protects tissues \\nfrom damage, as Ã¡ma returns to the GI tract. Fi -\\nnally, since VÃ¡yu is responsible for movement, oil \\nlubrication restores proper VÃ¡yu functioning, al -\\nlowing for proper flowing of wastes and toxins to \\ntheir removal sites.\\nSpecial herbs blended with the oils enable the \\ntissues to expel the oil from tissues. Therefore, \\noil does not accumulate in the body. Herbs like \\nguÃ¦ÃºchÃ­, kaÃ³uka, harÃ­takÃ­, yaÃ¤hÃ³Ã­ madhu (licorice), \\nand chitrak have bitter properties that cause oils \\nto be expelled. Specific oil massage (abhyaÃ±ga) \\ntherapies are discussed later in this chapter.\\nOils and purificatory therapies are useful for ar -\\nthritis, insomnia, paralysis, tremors, convulsions, \\nnervous exhaustion, dry cough, constipation, and \\nother VÃ¡yu derangements. Oil is also useful for \\nalcohol addiction, the elderly, children, eye prob -\\nlems, tumors, sinus conditions, worms, ulcers, \\nmemory, dryness, poisons, VÃ¡yu, Pitta, and Ka -\\npha diseases. Such therapies promote alertness, \\nslimming, toning, and studying the body; improv -\\ning strength, voice, complexion, and they cleanse \\nthe female genital passage. Oil builds plasma, re -\\nproductive fluid and ojas (life-sap). Kapha doÃhas \\nuse oil for worms and gas.\\nSesame is the best oil. Overall, oil reduces VÃ¡yu, \\nis neutral for Kapha, and increases Pitta. Oils are \\nused during the rainy season.\\nContraindications:  There are some people for \\nwhom oleation is not recommended.

Use drying \\nherbs for 10 days following child-birth.\\nAfter taking ghee, one drinks hot water. After \\noil, one drinks boiled rice water. This should cause \\nbelching and a desire to eat.

Ch. 1, \\nverse 8\\nAccording to AÃhÃ³Ã¡Ã±ga H^idaya m, after ole -\\nation, steam or sweating therapies are employed \\nfor effective dislodging and liquefying of toxins \\nand improving digestion. Svedhana causes the \\nbodyâs channels to widen, enabling Ã¡ma to easily \\nflow from the tissues back to the GI tract and im -\\nprove circulation. Heat allows the skin and blood \\n(outer disease pathway) to be cleansed. This re -\\nlieves, cleanses, and reduces fat tissue and muscle \\ntension.\\nHeat also restores balance to VÃ¡yu and Kapha \\n(i.e., removing coldness and stiffness) and reduces \\nthe heavy, sticky nature of Ã¡ma. Once toxins are \\nback in the G.I. tract, they are ready to be com -\\npletely expelled from the body through paÃ±cha \\nkarma (five purificatory actions).\\nInternal (e.g., spicy herbs) and external (e.g., ja -\\ncuzzi, sauna) heat are used to dislodge wastes and \\ntoxins. Castor, arka, red punarnavÃ¡, sesame, and \\nbarley all induce sweat.\\nFour types of Svedhana therapies exist,\\n1. TÃ¡pa  or fomentationâplacing a heated cloth, a metal object or warm hands on the body. This \\ntherapy is best for VÃ¡yu and Kapha doÃhas.\\n2. UpanÃ¡ha  or applying a hot poultice to the body \\n(before bed) made with the appropriate herbs and \\nfoods to reduce the respective aggravated doÃhas. \\nAfter the poultice is applied, an oiled and heated \\nsilk or woolen cloth is wrapped around the body, \\nand the person goes to sleep for the night. It is \\nremoved in the morning (in the winter it may be \\nkept on longer). This therapy is best for VÃ¡yu dis -\\norders. General ingredients include wheat, barley, \\nunctuous substances, kuÃhÃ³a, kÃ¡kolÃ­, and kÃhÃ­r-\\nkÃ¡kolÃ­.\\nVÃ¡yu: Poultices include vachÃ¡, aromatic herbs, \\nyeast, licorice, cedar, castor oil, ghee, lassi, milk.\\nVÃ¡yu/Kapha: TriphalÃ¡, t^ikatu.

Boil until it becomes a thick liquid and \\napply to the whole body (in the direction against \\nthe hairs). When it becomes cold, reapply. This \\nprocess is repeated many times.\\nOther heating therapies include exercise, stay -\\ning in warm, draftless rooms, wrapping oneself in \\nheavy clothes, and sunbathing.\\n3. ÃÃ¤hmÃ¡  or warm steam is used by boiling the \\nappropriate foods and herbs for a doÃha, and al -\\nlowing the steam to surround the body. Steam \\nmay be applied with a sweat box (with the head \\nkept free from heat) or apparatus like a pressure \\ncooker. Appropriate herbs are added to the water \\nin the pot.

This can be done seasonally or yearly \\nfor to maintain good health.\\nResults of excess sweat therapy:  Pitta and blood \\nexcesses, thirst, fainting, weak voice and body, \\ngiddiness, joint pain, fever, blue, black, or red \\nskin patches, vomiting. To antidote the excesses, \\nastringent therapy (i.e., light, cool, dry, bitter, as -\\ntringent) and sweet therapy are used.\\nIf one only follows the preliminary practices, \\nthen the toxins return to their site of accumula -\\ntion, but are not removed. This may cause distress or disease as toxins can be reabsorbed and return \\nto their site of accumulation.\\nFor VÃ¡yu doÃhas, failure to follow oil and \\nsweating with an enema may create a variable ap -\\npetite, gas, distention, constipation, and insomnia.  \\nIncomplete Pitta practices may cause irritability, \\nfever, and hyperacidity. For Kapha doÃha, it may \\ncause loss of appetite, fatigue, or constipation.\\nPost Svedhana\\nAfter sudation, persons receive a slow and gen -\\ntle massage followed by a warm water bath (to \\ncalm the person and to wash off the toxins that \\nhave been expelled through the skin). A whole -\\nsome diet is followed thereafter. Exercise and \\ndrinking of cold water is are avoided on this day. \\nFresh air, a warm bath or shower, and a nap after \\nlunch is advised.\\nPaÃ±cha karma therapies (see below) are begun a \\nset number of days after svedhana, \\nVamanaâsecond day after svedhana \\nVirechanaâthird day after svedhana Basti, \\nNasya, Rakta MokÃhaâjust after\\nPaÃ±cha Karma (five actions) returns toxins to \\ntheir sites of origin to be properly eliminated. \\nThis differs from most other healing systems that \\nmainly flush the various organs or body systems \\nregardless if the toxins are present.

These therapies \\nare employed for acute diseases as well. For ex -\\nample, emesis (vomiting therapy) may be used \\nduring acute asthma attacks, obesity, and acute \\nKapha disorders. As mentioned before, the per -\\nson needs to be strong before undertaking paÃ±cha \\nkarma because these reducing therapies tempo -\\nrarily weaken the system.\\nAdditionally, paÃ±cha karma is used to prevent \\nthe accumulation of the humors, or as a seasonal \\nhealth maintenance and a longevity/rejuvenation \\nprogram. What is unique about this Ãyurvedic ap -\\nproach is that it is used not only for healing, but \\nalso for prevention and rejuvenation (longevity).\\nEnemas that include tonics and nutritive herbs \\nare also used in supplementation therapy, as they \\nbuild tissues rather than reduce humors. Thus, pa-\\nÃ±cha karma offers various therapies that may be \\nused in various ways, depending upon the person, \\ndisease, season, culture, etc. The milder therapies \\nmay be used seasonally in self-healing, preven -\\ntion, and rejuvenation.\\nTherapeutic Vomitng (Vamana)\\nOf all the five paÃ±cha karma therapies, this is the \\nmost dangerous; one can strain to vomit and dam -\\nage the nerve reflexes. With proper guidance one \\nlearns the method for oneself or consults a quali -\\nfied paÃ±cha karma specialist. It is done regularly \\nto cleanse the stomach and remove Ã¡ma (toxins) \\nand mucus from the nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­s (channels) and chest. \\nIt is used for relieving recent fever, diarrhea, pul -\\nmonary TB, and all lung conditions, skin diseases \\n(e.g., eczema, psoriasis, leukoderma), diabetes \\nmellitus, goiter, tumors, cough, asthma, and dif -\\nficult breathing. Vamana is also useful for nausea, \\nherpes, head and sinus diseases, allergies, chronic \\ncolds, rhinitis, rheumatic diseases, arthritis, viral \\ndisorders (e.g., herpes zoster), insanity, parasites \\n(filariasis), bleeding of a downward nature, and excess salivation. It helps heal hemorrhoids, an -\\norexia, cervical adenitis, edema, epilepsy, confu -\\nsion, abscesses, and sore throats.\\nVamana helps heal obesity, ear discharge, epi -\\nglottis, uvulitis, stiff neck, acute fever, Kapha fe -\\nver, and nasal discharge. It is also useful for indi -\\ngestion, gastroenteritis, alasaka, poison, chemical \\nburn, and diseases due to bad breast milk.

The heating effect \\nof vacha begins to reduce the Ã¡ma and, because \\nheat rises, prepares the body for emesis.\\nThe next morning the stomach remains empty \\n(i.e., donât eat), causing further secretions to de -\\nvelop in surrounding tissues, promoting secre -\\ntion movement to the stomach. After meditation \\npersons undergo mild snehana  and svedhana , \\nincreasing body temperature and insuring expan -\\nsion of tissues and subtle channels.\\nNext one eats 1 1/2 cups of a thin, sweet-tasting porridge of rice or wheat cooked with milk, salt, \\nand a little ghee .

Another recipe \\nusing madan phal adds 4 parts of the herb with \\nvachÃ¡ (2 parts), rock salt (1 part), and is used with \\nraw honey as its vehicle ( anupÃ¡na ).\\nIf no urge to vomit exists, pippalÃ­ , Ã¡malakÃ­ , \\nvachÃ¡ and salt are added to the tea. The proper-\\nties of honey and rock salt liquefy the mucus. In \\norder for vamana to proceed easily, persons can \\ndrink large quantities of licorice tea prepared the \\nnight before as a cold infusion (soaking the herb \\nin room-temperature water). Licorice collects \\ntoxins from tissues without it being absorbed into \\nthe body itself.\\na) Milder liquids include one or two cups of \\nmild carminative tea (mint, fennel, etc.â2 tsp. \\nherbs are infused into 1 cup of water). Children, \\nthe elderly, debilitated, impotent, and frightened \\npeople drink milk with raw sugar, honey, and rock \\nsalt. The amount ingested depends upon the sever -\\nity of the illness. A moderate dose is 2 3/4 ounces \\nof a decoction, fresh juice extract, or infusion; 1 \\n3/4 ounces for powders or paste.\\nWhile facing the east, one should recite a prayer \\nof health.

Sitting on a seat par -\\nallel to the knees (some suggest squatting), one \\nfeels the reflex, then attempts to vomit. If unable \\nto vomit, the person places a spoon or finger in \\nthe back of the throat (without harming the throat) \\nto stimulate the emetic reflex. The head and ribs \\nare supported by another person, and the navel \\nand back are massaged in an upward direction. If \\nexcess Kapha exists, then Kapha-reducing herbs \\n(e.g., hot or pungent) are also drunk. When excess \\nPitta exists, sweet and cold herbs are used. For \\nKapha/VÃ¡yu diseases, salt, oily, and sour herbs \\nare used. If Kapha is deficient, emetic herbs are \\nused.\\nc) One makes sure the stomach is empty from \\nvomiting. Once the vomit reflex occurs, it is ad -\\nvised to let it proceed all the way. Allowing for a \\nfew good reflexes is easier than many weak ones. \\nThis ensures the likelihood of not developing side \\neffects.

If some of the licorice has en -\\ntered the small intestine, persons may experience \\ntwo or three loose stools over the next 12 hours.\\nThe amount expelled during vamana is meas-\\nured by the practitioner to determine proper elim -\\nination.

It is an excellent \\nmethod to heal various conditions, including ab -\\ndominal tumors, hemorrhoids, smallpox, patches \\nof skin discoloration on the face, jaundice, chron -\\nic fevers, and enlarged abdomen. Virechana heals \\npoisoning, vomiting, spleen diseases, abscesses, \\nblindness, cataracts and other eye problems, colon \\npain, and colitis. It further heals vaginal diseases, \\ndiseases of the semen, intestinal parasites, ulcers, \\ngout, bleeding diseases in the upward direction, \\nblood toxins and diseases, suppression of urine, \\nand obstructed feces.\\nPurgatives eliminate excess Pitta from its site \\nin the liver, gall bladder, and small intestine (it \\ndoes not deal with the large intestine). The bitter \\npurgatives like rhubarb, senna, or aloe also clean \\nthe liver and gall bladder, decongest bile and re -\\nmove obstructions to its flow. They are preferred \\nfor Pitta and liver disorders (e.g., gall stones). Be -\\ncause this cleansing weakens the digestive fire, it \\nis not always recommended for VÃ¡yu doÃhas. Ka-\\npha doÃhas, however, benefit from this therapy, as \\nthey have excess bile, congestion, fat, or phlegm. \\nIt also helps constipation, old fevers, acute diar -\\nrhea, dysentery, food poisoning, kidney stones, \\nboils, carbuncles, excess bile, or toxic blood con -\\nditions.\\nFor those who have not had vamana (emesis), \\nthere are 3 days of snehapÃ¡na, followed by 3 days \\nof body oleation and sudation before beginning \\nvirechana (purgation). If virechana follows a va-\\nmana therapy, then after the 7 days of proper diet \\n(samsarjana), 2 days of regular meals are eaten. On the 9th day, snehapÃ¡na (drinking ghee) is \\nbegun for 3 days. The following 3 days persons \\nreceives oil abhyaÃ±ga and sudation for three ad -\\nditional days. On this 15th day (since starting \\nsamsarjana) virechana is begun. If sudation is \\ncontraindicated, then virechana begins after the \\nthird day of snehapÃ¡na (drinking ghee).\\nPrecautions:  Virechana is not recommended for \\nthose people with recent fevers, poor digestion, \\nbleeding diseases of a downward nature (e.g., \\nhemorrhoids), ulcers, rectum ulcers, and diar-\\nrhea. Nor is it recommended for those who have \\nrecently received a decoction enema, have hard -\\nened feces, suffer from TB, and are greatly lubri -\\ncated. It is not used for the very young or very old, \\nthe weak, debilitated or emaciated, while preg -\\nnant, during or immediately before menstruation, \\nor with prolapse of the stomach or uterus.\\n \\nMethod:  The stool is examined to determine the \\nnature of the purgation therapy to be used. Soft \\nstools suggest mild virechana (e.g., boiled milk, \\nghee, honey, and cinnamon), while hard stools \\nwill require stronger purgative herbs (like tripha -\\nlÃ¡, castor oil, rhubarb, or senna). For Pitta disor -\\nders, herbs of astringent, and sweet tastes are add -\\ned. Kapha excesses require pungent herbs. VÃ¡yu \\ndisorders require rock salt, ghee, and hot herbs. It \\nis important for persons to undergo 3 to 7 days of \\noleation (internal and external) before purgation \\nif they havenât already gone through the process \\nfor vamana. \\nTime : According to AÃhÃ¾Ã¡Ã±ga H^idayam, the time \\nof purgation is after vamana (emesis), and after \\n9:00 a.m. (the end of the Kapha time of day). This \\nis done with rapidly acting purgatives. Others sug -\\ngest medium to mild doses to be taken just before \\nsleep. Still others suggest eating dinner around \\n7:30 p.m. and taking virechana 9:30 p.m., then \\nretiring to bed. Some pundits say food should be \\nfully digested while others suggest waiting two \\nhours after the meal, until food passes out of \\nthe small intestine (fasting is advised for stron -', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

An example of a quick acting purgative is \\ncastor oil with two times as much triphalÃ¡. Purga -\\ntion can be done for 2 to 3 days in a row in severe \\nconditions, or 2 to 3 times every other day.

Ch. 1 verse 39\\nBasti therapy is primarily used for VÃ¡yu ex -\\ncesses, either alone, or as the predominant doÃha \\nderanged. Basti is the Sanskrit name for urinary \\nbladder. Originally the bladders of larger animals, \\nlike buffaloes and goats, were used as enema \\nbags. The colon is related to all other organs and \\ntissues, so by cleansing and toning the colon, the \\nentire body is healed and rejuvenated. The colon \\nis the main organ that absorbs nutrients. A healthy, \\nfunctioning colon is imperative for proper assimi -\\nlation of nutrients.\\nBasti is unlike Western enemas or colonics. En -\\nemas only cleanse the rectum and sigmoid colon \\n(only the lower eight to ten inches of the colon) \\ncausing an evacuating effect. Colonics remove fe -\\nces blocks but may weaken the mucus membranes \\nand dry the colon. This further imbalances VÃ¡yuâs \\nnormal elimination process. Basti, however, treats \\nthe entire length of the colon from the ileocecal \\nvalve to the anus. Not only is feces flushed from \\nthe system but also Ã¡ma is removed from the tis -\\nsues. Furthermore, balanced and healthy colon \\nfunction is restored as tissues and organs are re -\\nbuilt.\\nGeneral Benefits:  Basti is useful for many dis -\\norders including chronic constipation, sciatica, \\nlower back pain, arthritis, gout, and rheumatism. \\nIt also heals numerous neurological disorders like \\nParkinsonâs, MS, muscular dystrophy, paraplegia, \\nhemiplegia, poliomyelitis, osteoporosis, and mus -\\ncle and nerve atrophy. Further, basti helps with \\nmental conditions such as Alzheimerâs, epilepsy, \\nmental retardation, and sensory disorders.General Precautions:  Basti is not used for babies, \\nfor diarrhea, colon cancer, diverticulitis, rectal \\nbleeding, polyps, fever, and some forms of dia -\\nbetes. \\nThree types of bastis exist:\\n1. AnuvÃ¡sana (unctuous)âthis  enema remains \\nin the body for some time without causing harm. \\nMainly herbal medicated oils and ghee are used. \\nThe amount of oil used in anuvÃ¡sana basti is 48 \\nor 96 grams (1.7 oz. or 3.4 oz.). It is administered \\nthrough the rectum. It is given to all those who are \\nsuited for nirÃºha (non-unctuous basti), especially \\nthose having strong digestion, to those not receiv -\\ning oleation, and those with VÃ¡yu diseases (only). \\nThis form of enema is given before nirÃºha.\\nThis enema moistens dry tissues and organs, re -\\nduces hyperactive digestion, and VÃ¡yu disorders, \\nincluding nervous conditions.

In \\nthe remaining months, bastis are administered in \\nthe evening. Some suggest it be always given in \\ndaytime.

Next the person evacuates \\nstool and urine and then lies on a comfortable bed, \\nneither too high nor low (Charak adds, on white \\nsheets with head facing the East).

After the basti is administered and the nozzle \\nis removed, the person lies on their back while \\nthe practitioner gently hits the personâs buttock \\nseveral times. The person then slightly raises the \\nheels and buttocks and gently pounds against the \\nbed. Next, the foot of the bed is raised\\nthree times, followed by extending both legs. \\nA pillow is then placed under the legs, and the \\nperson receives an oil massage, working out any \\npainful or knotted spots. This helps the enema to \\nstay in longer (if the enema is soon expelled, an -\\nother oil enema is immediately given).\\n3. NirÃºha or water-based basti is held in the \\nbody for about 48 minutes. AnuvÃ¡sana or oil basti \\nmust remain in the body for 9 hours. Should the \\nelimination reflex cause early release of the fluids, \\nthey are reapplied.\\nIf, after anuvÃ¡sana, the person has regained a \\nstrong digestive fire, they can eat a light meal in \\nthe evening. If the oil does not come out due to the \\nexcessive dryness inside the body, and the person \\nfeels good, it can remain inside overnight. It is \\nexpelled in the morning by drinking warm water. \\nIf it does not come out after 24 hours, the person \\nis administered an herbal (fruit) rectal supposi -\\ntory or strong decoction enema. Signs of proper \\nadministration of enema include feeling relief \\nfrom the toxins, and finding the oil being expelled \\nalong with the feces, followed by gas.\\n4.

During menstruation the \\nuterus is not covered; therefore, it receives unc -\\ntion very easily. This allows for easy release of \\nVÃ¡yu.\\nAfter a meal (with ghee), passing stool, urine, \\nand after bathing, a person sits comfortably on a \\nstraight, soft, knee-high seat. The catheter is intro -\\nduced gently into the orifice, neither too deep nor \\ntoo shallow. The nozzle is greased with ghee and \\n20 grams (.7 of an ounce) of a decoction and is in -\\nserted into the body. As the decoction is expelled, \\nthe process is repeated another two times. If the \\nthird decoction is not released, it is all right. De -\\ncoction herbs include pippalÃ­, black salt, apÃ¡mÃ¡r -\\nga, mustard, nirguÃ²Ã¦Ã­, and cane sugar.

It is inserted into the genital tract up to four \\nfinger-widths deep. In the urethra, it is inserted up \\nto about two fingers deep. The catheter is easily \\ninserted while the woman lies on her back, with \\nlegs fully flexed. Douche is given 2 to 4 times \\nover the course of 24 hours. After the douche, a \\nsomewhat thicker suppository is inserted. This \\ntherapy continues for 3 days, with the dose gradu -ally increased. After a 3-day rest, the procedure is \\nrepeated.\\nNasal Therapy or Snuff (Nasya)\\nÃyurveda suggests that the nose is the gateway \\nto the head. Thus, nasal herb therapy is used for \\nhealing diseases of the throat, neck, head, and \\nsenses (e.g., ears, nose, eyes, etc.). Nasya is also \\nused for toning and strengthening these areas.\\nNasya is useful in relieving stiffness in the head, \\nneck arteries, throat, and jaw obstructions, coryza, \\nuvulitis, tonsillitis, cornea, vision and eyelid disor -\\nders, migraines, disorders of the neck, shoulders, \\nears, nose, mouth, head, cranium, and scapula. It \\nhelps facial paralysis, convulsions, goiter, pain, \\ntingling sensation, loose teeth, tumors, hoarse \\nvoice, speech disorders, and VÃ¡yu disorders of the \\nmind, head, neck, and throat. Nasya is also help -\\nful in head diseases caused by Kapha (e.g., stiff -\\nness, numbness, heaviness). Saturating nasyas \\nare recommended for VÃ¡yu disorders (e.g., facial \\nparalysis, trembling head). Pacifying nasyas are \\nuseful for internal bleeding and other Pitta head \\nand neck disorders.\\nSnuff is suggested three times daily in the rainy, \\nautumn, and spring seasons when there are no \\nclouds in the sky. Snuff is said to improve vision, \\nsmell, and hearing; keep hair from graying and \\nfalling out; prevent stiff neck, headache, and lock -\\njaw. It is also said that snuff relieves chronic rhini -\\ntis, and head tumors. The veins, joints, ligaments, \\nand tendons of the skull gain greater strength. The \\nface becomes cheerful and well developed; the \\nvoice becomes more melodious.

It improves eyesight, bald -\\ning, premature graying, loose teeth, earaches, cat -\\naracts, dry mouth, nose disorders, loss of voice, \\nVÃ¡yu-head disorders, and wrinkles. VÃ¡yu- and \\nPitta-reducing herbs are used. Four, 6, or 8 drops \\nconstitute the minimum, moderate, and maximum \\ndoses. Other sources suggest using only 3 drops.\\n2) Evacuating (Â£hiro-virechana):  Powders of \\npippalÃ­, viÃ¦aÂ´ga, apÃ¡mÃ¡rga, or any oil mixed with \\nthese herbs, is used to reduce Kapha and mucus in \\nthe throat, palate, or head. This procedure helps \\nwith food  aversion, headache, heavy head, cold, \\ncoryza, hemicrania (headache on one side of the \\nhead), edema, skin disorders, epilepsy, laryngitis, \\nworms, and hysteric convulsions. Four, 6, or 8 \\ndrops are the minimum, moderate, and maximum \\ndoses.\\n3) PratimarÃha:  This is also an uncting procedure \\nin which oil is dropped into the nose and expelled \\nthrough the mouth.

PaÃ±cha karma is sometimes repeated, for it \\nmay take several times to cleanse deeply seated \\ntoxins. This is especially true when following \\nshort term methods. Also, it may be repeated after \\n1 to 3 months. PaÃ±cha karma is recommended at \\nleast once a year.\\n2. It is important to resume or establish a diet \\nand lifestyle that is harmonious with oneâs consti -\\ntution. If a person returns to old, bad habits, they \\nmay worsen their condition by suppressing the \\nrenewed healing energies. The toxins may then \\ndirectly enter cleansed tissues and go deeper than \\nbefore, causing severe diseases. During convales -\\ncence, persons avoid loud talking, bumpy rides, \\nlong walks, excessive sitting, and eating, if expe -\\nriencing indigestion.\\nTo avoid aggravating the humors, persons also \\navoid eating unwholesome food, day naps, and \\nsexual relations. If any of these harmful experi -\\nences are followed, follow-up toning and reju -\\nvenation processes are used to counteract the ill \\neffects.\\n3. Once therapy is successful or complete, the \\nnext step is rebuilding the tissues damaged by \\nthe disease, giving them a new level of strength \\nand purity. Oil or ghee is first taken with grad -\\nual reintroduction of the six tastes. First, sour, sweet, and delicious tastes are taken. Then one \\ntakes sour and salty tastes. Next bitter and sweet \\ntastes are introduced. These dual tastes are used \\nin these combinations to make food delicious. \\nLastly, astringent and pungent ones are taken in \\nsmall quantities as a hygienic measure to clean \\nthe mouth and sliminess. Rebuilding the healthy \\ncells and tissues is known as rejuvenation, and is \\nthe basis of the Ãyurvedic approach to longev -\\nity. Deeper tissue rejuvenation is most important \\nbecause this is the source of the bodyâs energy or \\nlife-sap (ojas). Herbs that increase ojas for each \\ndhÃ¡tu (tissue) layer are included in the chart at the \\ntop of the next page. BrÃ¡hmÃ­ rasÃ¡yana, a mixture \\nof gotu kola, ghee, and other herbs is an important \\nrejuvenative.\\nOrgans and Herbs\\nHerbs and foods can be used specifically to \\nrebuild tissue layers, and herbs can also have a \\ndirect rejuvenative effect on the various body or -\\ngans and tissue layers.

Because every practitioner has their own \\nstyle of this traditional therapy, both traditional \\nand modern approaches will be discussed.\\nHistory\\nMore than 2,000 years ago in India, oils were \\nfound that not only healed illness, but also pre -\\nvented future imbalances. These therapies were \\ntraditionally given (to oneself or to others) on a \\ndaily basis. Oil was poured onto the entire body \\n(also called abhyaÃ±ga), head (Â¤hiro bhyaÃ±ga and \\nÂ¤hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡), ears (karna pÃºrana), feet (pÃ¡da \\nbhyaÃ±ga), or specific sites that required attention \\n(marma bhyaÃ±ga).\\nLymphatic System:  One important benefit from \\nabhyaÃ±ga is the stimulation of the lymphatic sys -\\ntem. The lymph system is pervasive throughout \\nthe body, except in the brain, bone marrow, and \\ndeep skeletal muscle (though some scientists be -\\nlieve they may extend there as well). The role of \\nthis system is to carry nutrients to and remove \\ntoxins from the cells. Some cells in the nodes de -\\nstroy bacteria, viruses, and other potential harm -\\nful particles. Other vessels send fresh fluids from \\nthe other side of the node to the heart.\\nLymph contains about half the concentration \\nof proteins in the plasma, and returns the serum \\nproteins to the blood. Thus, this is a sort of self-\\nfeeding, \\n \\n system that means the body prepares its \\nown food and feeds itself. Additionally, it con -\\ntains many white blood cells that help maintain \\nthe bodyâs resistance to immune disorders, form -\\ning these infection-fighting cells in the nodes.\\nThis system contains various amino acids. One \\namino acid called tryptophan is needed for pro -\\nducing energy and balancing the hormonal and \\nnervous systems. Melatonin a brain hormone syn -\\nthesized from tryptophan within the pineal gland, is believed to be related to the thyroid, adrenals, \\nand gonads. It has been found to help calm excess \\nmental activity. Dopamine beta hydroxylase, is an \\nenzyme believed to be related to schizophrenia \\nand other mental disorders. Histaminase, another \\nenzyme, breaks down histamine. If histamine is in \\nexcess, it may cause gastric acidity, lethargy, itch -\\ning, headaches, pain in muscles and nodes; and \\nallergies. Thus, abhyaÃ±ga may help the body pro -\\nduce its own natural antihistamines. Lymphs also \\nplay a role in the various forms of edema.\\nThe lymph system is Kapha in nature. Â£hleÃha -\\nka Kapha is a mixture of lymph and synovial flu -\\nid found in the joints and also runs through the \\nnervous system. Lymph provides the nerves with \\nreceiving and transmitting signals. It also helps \\ndevelop antibodies that are important for the im -\\nmune system.\\nBy rubbing the joints in a circular motion, cir -\\nculation is enhanced and rubbing the joints in a \\ncircular motion secretes fluid secreted from the \\nlymph nodes. This causes more protein, glucose, \\nminerals oxygen, and antibodies, involved with \\nthe lymphatic system, to circulate in the blood.\\nBenefits of AbhyaÃ±ga:\\nThe AÃhÃ¾Ã¡Ã±ga H^idayam, one of the triad of the \\nclassical Ãyurvedic texts, suggests abhyaÃ±ga be \\ngiven on a daily basis to prevent and heal illness. \\nMany benefits arise from daily abhyaÃ±ga.

Symptoms \\nof aging include gray hair and wrinkles; loss of \\nsleep, teeth, impairment of sight and hearing; \\nweakened digestion and elimination; and brittle \\nbones (osteoporosis, arthritis, weakened spine, \\ncalcification, stiffness, etc.). Other signs of ag -\\ning include pains, giddiness, Parkinsonâs disease, \\nheart, artery, and blood pressure problems; de -\\ncreased mental function (memory, concentration, \\netc.), and diseases of the various organs. Through \\ndaily abhyaÃ±ga life is maintained and people \\ncan live a normal life span (longevity or ÃyuÃh).  \\nMethod:  Sesame, mustard, or almond oil, applied \\nto the spine, head, and feet, remove effects of old \\nage and increase longevity.\\nFatigue  (Â£hrama) results from hard work, stress, \\npoor diet, lack of exercise, not protecting oneself \\nfrom the environment, etc. These habits weaken \\nthe muscles, nerves, and joints. AbhyaÃ±ga pro-\\nvides a passive exercise, cleanses stress from the \\nmuscles, removes toxins from the organs, cells, \\ntissues, and blood; and tones the muscles and \\nnerves.\\nMethod:  Rubbing, patting, squeezing of muscles. \\nAdd sandalwood oil to the oil mixture.\\nFor fatigue caused by straining muscles add a \\npinch of salt to warm water and soak the limb.\\nAdding a heating oil such as mint, eucalyptus, \\nor mustard helps fatigue due to toxin accumula -\\ntion.\\nNervous disorders  (VÃ¡yu Roga) occur due to ex -\\ncess air (VÃ¡yu), which is the element that regulates \\nsensory-motor skills. It is also the most important \\nelement because it regulates the other two doÃhas \\n(Pitta regulates the metabolism and enzyme and digestive functioning. Kapha regulates the body \\norgans). So, balancing VÃ¡yu is necessary; daily \\nabhyaÃ±ga achieves this balance. \\nMethod:  MahÃ¡nÃ¡rÃ¡yan oil removes air imbal -\\nances that aggravate the nervous system.\\nEye (DriÃhti) sight is weakened by poor light -\\ning, poor posture, reading print that is too small, \\nexcessive television, gazing at overly bright or \\nflashing lights, (e.g., the sun, neon, and flashing \\nsigns), receiving excess sun, heat, or cold to the \\nhead; excess eating and drinking of pungent and \\noily foods. Additionally, old age causes impair -\\nments such as cataracts, near- and farsightedness, \\nnight blindness, optic nerve problems, etc. Poor \\nor improper diet creates an inflamed or detached \\nretina, atrophy of the optic nerve, etc. Ãyurveda \\nalso believes that constipation causes various eye \\nproblems.

They \\nmay develop nerve and bone disorders, constipa -\\ntion, anxiety, and weak immune disorders.

The head and feet receive even \\nmore pressure, and more time is spent on these \\ntwo areas. Soft, less fleshy, and less muscular \\nareas are also gently pressed (e.g., navel region, \\ntemples, heart, and ribs).\\nAbhyaÃ±ga Time:\\nDaily abhyaÃ±ga is done 1 to 2 hours after eat -\\ning, preferably yoga or exercise (until persons \\nbreak a sweat) is practiced after abhyaÃ±ga. It is \\nbest to wait at least 1 hour after abhyaÃ±ga before \\ntaking a bath to let the oil nourish and detoxify all \\nthe tissue layers. The oil also keeps the body and \\nskin flexible.

It nurtures \\nall seven tissue elements in less than 14 minutes. \\nIngesting herbs takes a longer time because they \\npass through the digestive system.\\nSpecific AbhyaÃ±ga Therapies:\\nBesides the general benefits of healing difficult \\ndiseases and promoting longevity, each special \\nabhyaÃ±ga method offers unique therapeutic prop -\\nerties. Some of the approaches offer both tradi -\\ntional and modern uses. Traditional methods are \\nused along with paÃ±cha karma practices. Mod -\\nern approaches are generally from Indiaâs Kerala \\nstate. These modalities can be used for healing by \\nthemselves; there is no need for emesis, purga -\\ntion, and enemas. \\nPressure:  Two views on abhyaÃ±ga pressure exist: \\nAccording to doÃha and according to guÃ²a (qual -\\nity). As mentioned above, a person can receive \\nabhyaÃ±ga with light, moderate, or deep touch, de -pending on whether they are VÃ¡yu, Pitta, or Kapha \\ndoÃhas, respectively. A second option is to apply \\npressure according to how much purity (sattwa), \\nheat/energy (rajas), and grounding (tamas) one \\nneeds. For example, if a person is experiencing \\nmild imbalances (e.g., the start of a cold), then a \\ngentle, sattwic touch is used. If a moderate im -\\nbalance exists (e.g., a full-blown cold) then more \\nheat and energy (rajas) is used. Lastly, if the im -\\nbalance is great (e.g., chronic bronchitis), then an \\neven deeper pressure (tamasic) must be exerted.\\nAnother dimension is also considered. If a per -\\nson is experiencing a VÃ¡yu (air) excess (e.g., con -\\nstipation), then moderate, warming (rajas); and \\ndeep, grounding (tamas) pressures may be used. \\nLikewise, if oneâs imbalance is too grounded (i.e., \\nexcess Kapha/overweight) then moderate and \\nlight touches energize and enlighten the overly \\ngrounded imbalance. Lastly, if there is too much \\nof the rajasic (heat) imbalance (e.g., skin rash), \\nthen cool (mild/ sattwic) and moist (deep/ tama -\\nsic) pressure is exerted. The practitioner chooses \\nthe most comfortable and balancing methods for \\neach client.\\nYet another view suggests that for serious dis -\\norders like high blood pressure, light abhyaÃ±ga \\n(done only with the fingers from the middle of the \\nchest out to the sides), or no abhyaÃ±ga at all is to \\nbe done over the chest. Persons with low blood \\npressure receive only foot abhyaÃ±ga. AbhyaÃ±ga is \\nnot advised for fevers or skin diseases. AbhyaÃ±ga \\nis avoided over troubled areas such as stomach \\ndiseases or bone injuries.\\nÃyurveda suggests that abhyaÃ±ga be given and \\nreceived by members of the same gender. This al -\\nlows for a better exchange of energy. Of course, \\nfamily members will enjoy giving and receiving \\nabhyaÃ±ga to each other.

Oil penetrates the skin, all the \\ntissues are fed, and the toxins contained within \\nthe tissues are released. Oil takes five minutes \\nto permeate the skin completely. Then it spreads \\nthrough the seven dhÃ¡tus (tissues). Oil moves \\nthrough each dhÃ¡tu in less than two minutes (100 \\nseconds).\\nThe method suggested below describes a gen -\\neral overview. For every practitioner differences \\nin style will exist. As abhyaÃ±ga is practiced on \\nfamily members and clients, persons will slowly \\ndevelop their own style.\\nTwo-person abhyaÃ±ga  uses approximately 1 1/4 \\ncups of oil (appropriate to oneâs constitution). \\nOne method of abhyaÃ±ga suggests a time sched -\\nule lasting approximately five minutes per set of \\nbody parts (i.e., both arms, shoulders, neck, torso, \\nback, legs, and feet). This lasts about a 45 min -\\nutes.Various techniques, such as rubbing, sliding, \\nkneading, etc., may be employed. Joints are mas -\\nsaged in a circular motion. Generally, the hands \\nfollow the contour of the body. One view suggests \\nmassaging only in the direction of the hair. An -\\nother belief considers massaging in the direction \\nthat the blood flows. The key factor is that one \\npractitioner determines the style, speed, and pres -\\nsure, while the second practitioner mirrors these \\nmovements and amount of pressure.\\nWhen oil is applied and rubbed in, toxins are \\ndislodged from the tissues and returned to the \\nblood system.

Gentle rubbing is more relaxing, \\nwhereas vigorous rubbing creates passive exer -\\ncise. Oil rubbed under the joints works the lymph \\nsystem. Circular motion on specific points ( mar-\\nmasâdiscussed later) releases growth hormones. \\nComfortable pressure is always be applied during \\nabhyaÃ±ga. Creating a rhythm is another important \\npart of the rubbing technique.\\nSqueezing is the fourth phase in this abhyaÃ±ga \\nprocess.

The \\nmarma points are similar to Chinese acupuncture, \\nonly no invasive use of needles is involved.\\nMarma points are positions on the body where \\nflesh, veins, arteries, tendons, bones, and joints \\nmeet. They may be seen as the junctions where \\nVÃ¡yu, Pitta, and Kapha meet; where sattwa, rajas, \\nand tamas meet; or where eternity and relativity \\nmeet. Some say they are also the points where the \\nthree aspects of Self-realization meet, i.e., inner \\nSelf, outer world, and between the two (knower, \\nknown, and process of knowing). They may also \\nbe the junctions between the physical, astral, and \\ncausal bodies. In short, they are points that have \\ngreat importance to a personâs body, mind, and \\nspirit.Movements are down,\\n(i.e., in the direction the\\nhair grows), and following\\nthe contours of the body.\\n     Circles are made\\naround joints.\\nCircle around shoulder,\\nelbow, wrist, knee, and\\n ankle joints.Follow the \\ncontours\\non the backAbhyaÃ±ga\\nChest may \\nfollow circular \\npattern in the\\ndirection of the \\nhair.[Hands may\\nmove up lightly,\\nbut pressure is\\napplied in the \\ndownward \\ndirection]Another technique\\nis to massage from the \\ninner arm to the legâdown,\\nand from the outer hand\\nand footâup (in the \\ndirection of the blood\\nflow).\\nAlthough the marmas are the junctions of all \\nfive principles (i.e., flesh, veins, arteries, tendons, \\nbones, and joints), at each point a predominance \\nof one principle exists. It is at these points where \\nabhyaÃ±ga can most effectively restructure or re -\\nbalance the system to function most healthily. \\nFurther, abhyaÃ±ga helps develop the preventive \\nhealth and longevity of the body and mind by en -\\nsuring the proper balance and flow of hormones, \\nfluids, immune factors, etc.\\nOne hundred seven marma points exist on the \\nbody. This makes it much easier to remember and \\nwork with, compared with the thousands of points \\nin Chinese acupuncture. Ãyurveda details ma -\\njor (mahÃ¡) and minor marma points. The major \\npoints correspond to the major chakras (secret en -\\nergy points) on the body, while the minor points \\nare found around the torso and limbs.

Like \\nacupuncture, these points are measured by finger \\nunits (aÂ´guli or aÂ´gula) to detect their correct lo -\\ncations. Many marma points are larger than acu -\\npuncture points. Thus, they can be found more \\neasily.\\nOne school of thought suggests that marmas \\nare not so much points as they are circular bands \\naround certain parts of the body. For example, a \\nmarma exists just above the knee (the width of the \\nclientâs four fingers above the middle of the knee), \\nknown as Ani Marma. This marma relates to the \\nsmall intestine. It is also situated on the back of \\nthe leg, directly behind this spot. If one were to \\nmove the hands from the front Ani Marma, in a \\nstraight line to the back (i.e., by working the sides \\nof the leg that are in line with Ani Marma) this \\nmarma would also be stimulated. So when one \\nworks a marma point, they can affect the front, \\nsides, and back of a marma (i.e., encircling the \\narea around the arm or leg).\\nIn ancient India, it was cautioned that these mar-ma points were to be guarded from harm. If these \\npoints were pierced by arrows or hit forcefully, \\nit could result in disease, trauma or even death. \\nObviously, places like the heart, forehead, and \\nthroat are vulnerable areas, whereas sites on the \\narms and legs are less vulnerable to severe injury. \\nWhen imbalances exist in the body, these same \\nspots become sore. Through marma abhyaÃ±ga \\nhealth is restored.\\nMarma points are grouped according to the re -\\ngion of the body (arms [22 points] and legs [22 \\npoints] 11 per limb), abdomen [3 points], chest [9 \\npoints], back [14 points], and head and neck [37 \\npoints]). They are also grouped according to mus -\\ncles [10 points], tendons/ligaments [23 points], \\narteries [9 points], veins [37], joints [20 points], \\nand bones [8].

A doÃha excess \\nmeans an increase of that element in the body and/\\nor mind. These excesses or imbalances are mild or \\nsevere diseases (depending upon the degree of the \\nexcess). For example, excess VÃ¡yu can develop \\ninto constipation, dry skin, anxiety, etc. Further, \\nmost illnesses can be caused by any doÃha excess \\n(e.g., asthma can be caused by any of the doÃhas. \\nEach doÃha has its own unique set of symptoms. \\nThis enables one to detect the doÃha causing the \\ndisease). This yogic or spiritual tool is unique to \\nÃyurveda. Thus, one can fine tune or note distinc -\\ntions instead of merely working with generaliza -\\ntions. This insight into individualized symptoms is an invaluable tool in determining the root cause \\nof an illness.\\nEach doÃha has five aspectsâor sub- doÃhas \\nâthat further describe the different activities that \\neach doÃha performs. The sub- doÃhas govern var -\\nious body functions. For example, we know that \\none function of  VÃ¡yu is related to stool elimina -\\ntion. One sub- doÃha exists to specifically govern \\nthe downward movement of the air, called ApÃ¡na \\nVÃ¡yu. This added insight allowed the ancients to \\nknow which marma points were related to down -\\nward moving air, and to properly stimulate or re -\\nset this downward flow. Through abhyaÃ±ga and \\nstimulating marma points the downward flow air \\nflow can be restored or balanced.

KÃ¡ya Seka (Pizhichil)\\nThis form of abhyaÃ±ga is said to be most ben -\\neficial for rejuvenating the nervous system. In \\nthis method, the medicated oil used during dhÃ¡rÃ¡ \\nkarma is poured over the personâs body from a \\nheight of 15 aÂ´guli (head) and 13 aÂ´guli (body), \\nwhile simultaneously being rubbed into the body. \\nThese heights may cause the oil to splash on prac -\\ntitioners, so old clothing is worn. Pizhichil is also \\nknown as Taila Seka or SarvÃ¡nga Senchana. This \\nmethod strengthens the tissues and promotes the \\nbiological fire.\\nOil and ghee can be reused for another 3 days, \\nbut must be replaced on the 4th day. When milk \\nand vinegar are used they are replaced daily.\\nHealthy persons can receive kÃ¡ya seka twice \\ndaily, using a mixture of sesame oil and ghee. For \\nweaker persons a 2- to 6-day interval between \\nsessions is advised. The bodyâs luster and beauty \\nare enhanced, ojas becomes stabilized, and sense \\norgans are cleared. The process also promotes \\nlongevity, regeneration, and rejuvenation of the \\nbody. It is especially good for VÃ¡yu disorders. The \\nsame massage table, eye protection, and other oil \\nrequirements used in pinÃ¦a sveda and Â¤hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡ \\nare applied here (see page 238)\\nFor healthy persons, warm sesame oil and/or â¢\\nâ¢\\nâ¢ghee are used along with rejuvenating herbs \\n(e.g., Â¤hatÃ¡varÃ­, aÂ¤hwagandhÃ¡, guÃ¦ÃºchÃ­). Medi -\\ncated milk or sour vinegar can be used in place of \\nmedicated oil. For Pitta disorders, oil or ghee can \\nbe unheated. Kapha and VÃ¡yu disorders require \\nwarm oil. However, unheated oil is used on the \\nhead in all cases.\\nFour practitioners attend the seated person. \\nTwo practitioners massage from the shoulders to \\nthe navel, and the other two practitioners mas -\\nsage from the navel to the feet. In this approach, \\ncloths are soaked in ghee or oil and squeezed on \\nthe body (or oil is poured on the body from ves -\\nsels) with the right hand. The left hand rubs the \\noil into the body. Again, insuring uniform pres -\\nsure and movement, at a moderate speed, among \\nall the abhyaÃ±ga practitioners is important. Hand \\nstrokes start from the upper portion of the body \\nand move downward.\\nA cloth is tied around the eyebrows to prevent \\nliquids from dripping into the eyes. Again, oil ap -\\nplied to the body is lukewarm, while the oil ap -\\nplied to the head is at room temperature. A fifth \\npractitioner keeps the cloths in warm oil and re -\\nplaces them as they cool off. When lying down, \\nthe head faces the east in the morning and the \\nwest in the evening. The person receives massage \\nfor 1 hour in the same seven positions as in pinÃ¦a \\nsveda (page 236).\\nIf the treatment lasts for 14 or 21 days, the hour-\\nlong session is gradually increased by 5 minutes \\nfrom the 2nd day on, until it reaches 1 1/2 hours. \\nWhen it reaches 1 1/2 hours (i.e., the 7th day), the \\ntime of each session is shortened by 5 minutes. \\nFor the 21-day series, upon reaching the 7th day \\n(11/2hours), the sessions remain at the 1 1/2 hour \\ntime through the 14th day.

PinÃ¦a Sveda (Navarakizhi)\\nThis is considered the most important of all the \\nKeralÃ­yan methods. It is also used in traditional \\npaÃ±cha karma. PinÃ¦a sveda is a rejuvenation \\ntechnique that causes the entire body to perspire \\nby using medicinal puddings followed by abhya -\\nÃ±ga.\\nPinÃ¦a sveda makes the body supple, and re -\\nmoves stiffness, and swelling in the joints. It \\nheals VÃ¡yu diseases, clears obstructions, im -proves blood circulation, removes wastes from \\nthe body, improves complexion, increases Pitta, \\nstrengthens digestion, and restores vigor. It also \\nprevents excessive sleep while promoting sound \\nsleep. This therapy is very effective in healing \\ndisorders of the nervous system and brain (e.g., \\nparalysis, MS, chronic rheumatism, osteoarthri -\\ntis, gout, muscle emaciation, and toxic blood). \\nIt makes the entire body strong, sturdy, and well \\ndeveloped. The senses are sharpened and the ag -\\ning process is slowed. Insomnia, high blood pres -\\nsure, diabetes, skin disorders, balding, premature \\ngraying, and wrinkles are prevented. It is helpful \\nfor all neuromuscular diseases and some systemic \\n(whole body) diseases.\\nIn this procedure a warm bolus of medicated \\ngrain is applied to the body. Snehana or body oil \\napplication is a prerequisite for pinÃ¦a sveda. A \\ncloth is tied around the eyebrows to prevent oil \\nfrom dripping into the eyes.\\nPINÃA SVEDA BOLUS\\nPreparation of Decoction and Pudding:  About \\n17.5 ounces of balÃ¡ root (crushed chips) are \\npoured into two gallons of water and boiled until \\nonly 1/4 of the water remains. This decoction is \\nthen strained, leaving a 1/2 gallon quantity. One \\nquart of this decoction is mixed with one quart of \\ncowâs milk. The other quart is retained for later \\nuse. Next, about 17.5 ounces of dehusked and \\ncrushed rice is added and cooked until the decoc -\\ntion becomes a semisolid pudding (pÃ¡yasam).\\nEight pieces of soft and strong cloth, about 15 \\nsquare inches in size, are used to hold the pud -\\nding. The pudding is divided equally into 8 por -\\ntions and placed in the cloths.

A special abhyaÃ±ga table is used, \\njust like the Â¤hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡ table (see p. 237). Practi -\\ntioners use a table with or without legs; standing \\nor squatting while giving abhyaÃ±ga. Four practi -\\ntioners are required, along with a supervisor and \\nan attendant who heats and replaces the boluses. \\nAll four practitioners need to use the same de -\\ngree of pressure when rubbing. The atmosphere \\nis quiet. Traditionally men do abhyaÃ±ga on men \\nand women on women. All clothing is removed \\nexcept undershorts. The room is well ventilated, \\nwith soothing lighting. Drafts, dust, and direct \\nsunlight are to be avoided.\\nFour bundles are removed from the simmering \\nliquid and left to cool for five minutes. The bolus \\nis held by the tuft in the right hand and placed on \\nthe back of the left hand to check the tempera -\\nture.\\nMethod:  The session always begins at the neck, \\nand the movement is always in the downward di -\\nrection.

It is best not to have eaten \\nfor at least an hour before the therapy. The room \\nshould be clean, quiet, have fresh air, and no drafts. \\nAny windows should have curtains to prevent sun \\nglare and to ensure privacy. Soft-colored lights, \\nincense, or aromas suitable for the client help cre -\\nate a healthy and calming environment, even be -\\nfore the session begins. Soft spiritual music, like \\nclassical Indian ragas; can enhance the session. \\nRagas for each time of the day exist to further har -\\nmonize the relaxation and healing process.\\nBefore therapy, the practitioners meditate, pre -\\nparing themselves to be effective healers. Clients \\nand practitioners practice mantra meditation dur -\\ning the session to keep their minds spiritually fo -\\ncused.\\nWhether clients stay at an Ãyurvedic resort \\nfor several days or weeks, or make daily visits \\nfor Ã§hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡, they are advised to follow their \\nÃyurvedic lifestyle. Appropriate foods, baths, \\nexercise, spiritual studies, yoga, etc. are recom -\\nmended. This further balances oneâs constitution \\nand develops good habits. Thus, persons feel the \\nmaximum healing effects and find it easier to fol -\\nlow their program once they return home.\\nClients receiving weekly sessions, will find re -\\nlief from the stress and strain of their daily work \\nschedules. This is truly a constructive form of \\npampering.\\nIn a traditional session the client sits on the \\nmassage table facing east. Room-temperature oil \\nis poured through the hair three times. Then, the \\nbody is massaged below the neck (i.e., from the \\nshoulders down) with slightly warm oil. A cloth \\nis placed or tied over the eyes to prevent oil from \\nleaking into them during Â¤hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡.Practitioner and client can meditate before and \\nduring Ã§hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡ to bring the highest spiritual \\nenergy into the healing session\\nThe client is supine on a massage table with \\na pillow under their neck for comfort. Oil is re -\\nleased from the bowl onto the forehead. Tradition -\\nally, oil is circled on the third eye (just above and \\nbetween the eyebrows). Modern experience finds \\nthat many people find this directed application too \\npowerful. Thus, oil must be moved around the en -\\ntire forehead and temples.\\nWhen the oil in the bowl (or funnel) runs out, it \\nis once again placed in the bowl and reused. If the \\noil is cool, it can be reheated during the session or \\njust after the bowl is empty.\\nAfter the session is over, the client rests for a few \\nminutes on the table. The oil in the hair is pressed \\ninto the scalp as its warmth further soothes the cli -\\nent. Then a towel is placed over the head and the \\npractitioner helps the client sit up, making sure \\nthe head is covered with the towel to prevent the \\noil from dripping. The client is given a few min -\\nutes to adjust to the seated position. Then, they \\nare helped to stand up. Sometimes they are so re -\\nlaxed that they feel disoriented upon standing, so \\nhelping up them is important.\\nIf the weather is coolâto avoid catching a \\ncoldâa warm hat and scarf are worn when leav -\\ning the session. It is best that for the remainder \\nof the day the client rest, taking light meals, and \\nretire to bed early.\\nÂ£hiro Basti (Head-Soaking Oils)\\nÂ£hiro basti, like Â¤hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡, is another head oil \\napplication. However, in this method the oil soaks \\non the top of the head for some time.

Since these \\nproducts are scarce outside of India (and also for \\nthe sake of simplicity), plain oil or any of the \\nabove-mentioned medicated oils can be used.\\nPrecaution:  In some cases VÃ¡yu becomes aggra -\\nvated during extended treatments. To counter this, \\nclients receive a warm oil abhyaÃ±ga followed by \\na warm medicated bath.\\nDefinition:  Basti is defined as a bladder or con -\\ntainer that holds medicated herbs and oil. Â£hiro \\nbasti is somewhat similar to Â¤hiro dhÃ¡rÃ¡ in that \\nthe oil is placed on the head. The differences are \\nthat in Â¤hiro basti, the oil is kept soaking on the \\nhead.\\nThe bladder can be made of a flexible plastic, \\napproximately 3 feet high. The circumference is \\nwide enough to fit around the head. Whole-grain flour is mixed with warm water (2:1) and kneaded \\ninto dough. It is used between the head and blad -\\nder to prevent the oil from leaking. The dough is \\nplaced in a circle parallel to ear level. A belt or \\nrope is used to secure the bladder to the head.\\nMethod:  After a person completes the appropri -\\nate paÃ±cha karma therapies, oleation and fomen -\\ntation are given. Next, the person sits on a stool \\nor chair (knee-height). The paste is applied to the \\nhead under the cap to prevent the oil from leaking. \\nThe flour, cap, and belt are placed on the head. \\nThe medicated oil is heated to a lukewarm tem -\\nperature and is then placed in the bladder on the \\nhead. Oil should be about six inches above the \\nscalp (one finger width).\\nIt remains on the head for about 2 hours, 45 \\nminutes; 2 hours, 15 minutes; 1 hour, 40 minutes; \\nor until the mouth and nose begin to expel secre -\\ntions and clients feel relief from their symptoms. \\nThe length of time the oil remains on the head \\nvaries according to the doÃha causing the disorder \\n(VÃ¡yu, Pitta, Kapha respectively).\\nFor healthy persons who are merely receiving \\npreventive measures, oil remains on the head only \\nfor approximately 17 minutes.

The person lies on a bed in a draft -\\nless room. Their eyes are opened with the prac -\\ntitionerâs left hand, while the liquid is dropped \\nin the eye with the right hand. Ten to 12 drops \\nare placed in the eye from a distance of 2 finger \\nwidths from the inner angle of the eye.\\nA soft, clean cloth is placed over the eyes for a \\nfew minutes (a warm cloth is used for VÃ¡yu and \\nKapha disorders).\\nEye salve:  (Anjana) is used after a person has \\nundergone paÃ±cha karma, and the illness is local -\\nized only in the eyes, when diseases are matured, \\nsuch as in edema, severe itching, sliminess, and \\nthick excretions.\\nThree types of anjana exist:\\n1. Scraping (lekhana) using astringent, sour,\\nsalty, and pungent tastes\\n2. Healing (ropana) with bitter tastes\\n3. Vision clearing (prasÃ¡dana) using sweet\\ntastes\\nTime:  The recommended time for salves is \\nmorning or evening. Application is not recom -\\nmended before evening sleep, at noon, and when \\nthe sun irritates the eyesâbecause it increases \\nthe illness and spreads it elsewhere. For Kapha \\ndiseases that require scraping eye salve, daytime \\napplication is acceptable if it is not too hot a day. \\nDuring very cold weather, night application will \\nfurther aggravate the illness.Precautions:  Anjana is not used on those suffer -\\ning from fear, after emesis and purgation, when \\nhungry, when having the urge to urinate or defe -\\ncate; when angry, when feverish, or when the eyes \\nare tired. It is also not used with a headache, when \\nexperiencing grief and insomnia; when cloudy, af -\\nter smoking, when drinking alcohol, or just after \\nwashing hair. Anjana is not suggested with indi -\\ngestion, when tired due to excess exposure to fire \\nor sun, just after day naps, or when thirsty. This \\ntherapy may bring up strong emotional issues.\\nPost-Application:  Eyeballs are gently and brief -\\nly rubbed and slowly rotated up. The eyelids are \\nalso gently massaged. This is to spread the salve \\nthroughout the eye. It is not recommended to open, \\nclose, squeeze, or wash eyelids. When the salve \\nno longer has an effect, the eyes are washed (wa -\\nter temperature is according to the disease, doÃha \\nand season). This removes the disease cleansed \\nfrom the salve. The left eyelid is lifted and held \\nwith a piece of clean cloth in the fingers of the \\npractitionerâs right hand, and vice versa. If there \\nis itching or a lack of results from the salve, a \\nstronger salve or strong smoke inhalation is used. \\nPersons are strongly advised to rest in a darkened \\nroom for at least one hour before exposure to light \\nand activity.\\nEye-Bath (Netra Basti)\\n(Also discussed in Chapter 19)\\nThis therapy involves washing the eyes with \\nmedicated oils or ghee. Benefits include relieving \\ntension in the eye sockets that may lead to loss \\nof vision, pain, fatigue, glaucoma, cross-eye, con -\\njunctivitis, night blindness, cornea inflammation, \\nsunken eyes, and other eye disorders. Further, it \\nnourishes the nervous system, brain, memory, and \\ndevelops oneâs linguistic abilities.

It prevents dry -\\nness, cracks, and roughness of the skin; numb -\\nness, fatigue, sciatica, cramps; and contraction \\nof ligaments, vessels, and muscles of the feet and \\nlegs. It removes VÃ¡yu from the body, promotes \\nsturdy limbs and feet, strength for walking, and \\nsound sleep. Further, nerves from all the organs \\nin the head and body terminate in the feet (also in \\nthe hands, ears, and head). Thus, by rubbing the \\nfeet, persons tone the whole body. A close rela -\\ntionship exists between the feet, eyes, and ears. \\nFoot abhyaÃ±ga helps heal and prevent disorders \\nof hearing and sight. Four important nerves in the \\nsoles are connected to the head. Constant friction \\nand pressure on the nerves in the soles reduce eye \\nsight. AbhyaÃ±ga on a daily basis, or at least sev -\\neral times a week, restores health to these nerves. \\nIt is best done before bedtime, rubbing the soles \\nand tops of the feet with some warm sesame oil. \\nThis also fosters sound sleep.\\nGeneral Suggestions\\nAfter all abhyaÃ±gas, clients are advised to rest \\nfor 1 to 2 hours before returning home. It is best \\nif another person drives them home to avoid \\nthe stress of driving. If this is not possible, then \\nwhen reaching home, they rest. Light meals and \\nrest are advised for the remainder of the day. An \\nearly bedtime that evening is strongly suggested. \\nSome people find abhyaÃ±ga so relaxing that they \\nsleep through the next day, releasing deep-seated \\nstresses.\\nAs discussed earlier in this section, persons with \\nemotional problems may find the abhyaÃ±gas too \\npowerful.

These therapies \\nwork predominantly on the gross or outer physi -\\ncal level. Aroma therapy, gem therapy, color, \\nand mantra (or sound) therapies work on a more \\nsubtle level, healing through the mind, the senses, \\nand the absorption of subtle impressions. \\nAromas\\nPure fragrances are used for healing. Aromas \\nare commonly used in the forms of incense flower \\nessences, and essential oils. Other methods of aro -\\nmatherapy include pure scented candles, soaps, \\nand sachets. Aromas are most effective when pure \\n(i.e., not diluted with chemical substances). They \\nare used externally, and unless mixed with a dilut -\\ning or base oil, some oils burn the skin. If taken in -\\nternally, the mucus membranes would be harmed. \\nThey should not be placed too close to the eyes or \\nany bodily orifice.

This \\nchapter correlates the information in these books \\nwith Ãyurvedic physical and spiritual benefits.\\nMany approaches to yoga Ã¡sanas exist. Three \\nwell known methods are haÃ³ha, kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­, and \\naÃ¤hÃ³Ã¡Ã±ga. This chapter discusses and integrates \\nthese three yoga methods.\\nInterestingly, haÃ³ha yoga was also found in pre-\\nColombian cultureânot just confined to India. In \\nSt. Augustine, Columbia, ancient stone statues of \\npeople in yoga postures still exist today.\\nGeneral Information\\nThe underlying ideas to practicing yoga are \\nthe following:\\nBe gentle, do not force any posture  \\nForcing is against nature.\\nFeel complete at whatever stage of the position \\none can attain.\\nCompleteness or union is the goal,  \\nnot physical perfection of any posture\\nYoga Ã¡sanas have three purposes. First they can \\nbe used as a means to prepare the student (along \\nwith prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma breathing) for advanced spiritual practices like mantra sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation). This \\nis especially true for haÃ³ha yoga.\\nSecond, when practicing non-forceful medita -\\ntion, Ã¡sanas may occur automatically, cleansing \\nand integrating the mind, body, and spirit. Finally, \\nÃyurvedic practitioners may recommend these \\npostures for healing specific diseases.\\nHaÃ³ha yoga has healed diseasesâsome thought \\nto be incurableâfrom ancient eras in India through \\nmodern times. Its healing methods are explained \\nin its definition. Spiritually, yoga means the union \\nof the red spirit force at the base of the spine with \\nthe white spirit force at the crown of the head; the \\nunion of the sun-spirit at the navel with the moon-\\nspirit at the head; and the union of the small self \\nwith the Divine eternal Self.\\nPhysically, yoga means the union of prÃ¡Ã² (in-\\nward moving air) with apÃ¡n (downward/outward \\nmoving air); the union in which all the energy \\ncurrents in the body flow up the suÃ¤humÃ²Ã¡ or \\nmain inner tube of the spine. On either side of the \\nsuÃ¤humÃ²Ã¡ are two secondary tubes. âHaâ is the \\nsolar or right tube (piÂ´galÃ¡)â Pitta predominant. \\nâÃhaâ is the lunar or left channel or nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­, called \\niÃ¦Ã¡âVÃ¡yu/Kapha predominant. Thus, haÃ³ha \\nyoga means the union of all physical energy cur -\\nrents into these two channels, which subsequently \\nflow into the suÃ¤hum Ã²Ã¡.\\nEach school of yoga emphasizes different \\nthings. PataÃ±jali suggests that ethics (yama and \\nniyama) is the way to cleanse the mind, body, and \\nspirit; he emphasizes a more psychological ap -\\nproach to healing and Self-Realization. The book \\nHaÃ³ha Yoga PradÃ­pikÃ¡ suggests the bodyâs organs \\nand systems are to be cleansed first through Ã¡sa-\\nnas and prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m.

A soft, comfortable mat, blanket, or rug is \\nused when practicing Ã¡sanas.\\n2. Persons whose backs, spines, or necks are \\nbad or stiff should practice very gently. \\n3. Pregnant woman are advised to cease all \\nstrenuous and inverted poses, and not to lie on \\ntheir bellies.\\n4. Inverted postures (e.g., shoulder stands, head \\nstands) are life threatening to persons with heart \\nproblems, and should not be practiced by any -\\none with pressure problems (e.g., ear, nose, head, \\nheart).\\n5. The yoga room is to be pleas -\\nant, clean, ventilated, and free of drafts.  \\n6. It is always best to learn positions from a quali -\\nfied yoga teacher.\\n7. Yoga is first learned in the spring or fall; start -\\ning a course of yoga during winter or summer \\nmay cause health imbalances. \\n8. The practice of moderation and healthfulness \\nin diet prevents health imbalances. Foods that are \\ndifficult to digest, stale, very hot, or cold are not \\nrecommended.\\n9. Yoga is not to be practiced on a completely \\nempty stomach, nor on a full stomach. Beginners \\nare advised to take a little boiled milk and ghee \\nbefore practicing prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma.Part 1   \\nPostures (Ãsanas)\\nEighty-four million seated Ã¡sanas exist, as de -\\nscribed by Lord Ãhiva.

(The \\ntips of the thumb and index fingers touch, form -\\ning a circle with the fingers. The three remaining \\nfingers remain outstretched or uncurledâpalms \\nface upward.) This hand position is said to pre -vent the energy from flowing out of the body via \\nthe fingers. Alternatively, one practices the âChin \\nMudrÃ¡â.

This maintains the body, harmonizes un -\\nderactive or overactive functions, and removes \\nsluggishness and diseases arising from this condi -\\ntion. The pose strengthens the digestive fire (agni) \\nand improves nutrient absorption. It prevents the \\ncrown-moon nectar (neurohormones of the pitu -\\nitary and pineal glands that activate the endocrine \\nglands) from being burnt up by the navel-sun \\nheat. Thus, diseases of old age and death are pre -\\nvented or slowed. This nectar is associated with \\nthe bindÃº (semen/ovum). The navel or manipÃºra \\nchakra is powered by SamÃ¡na VÃ¡yu. This is re -\\nsponsible for nutrient and prÃ¡Ã²a absorption from \\nfood and air. This absorbs PrÃ¡Ã²a VÃ¡yu as well. \\nThrough this pose ApÃ¡na VÃ¡yu and PrÃ¡Ã²a VÃ¡yu \\nare made to meet at the manipÃºra chakra.

This keeps the mind locked into \\na âspecific-stateâ activity; not a state of freedom \\nand peace. In this state of mental silence one feels \\nclear-headed enough to make responsible deci -\\nsions, while maintaining a peaceful mind.\\nMental peace occurs when the life-breath ceases \\nto flow in the iÃ¦Ã¡ and piÂ´galÃ¡, and begins to flow \\nin the suÃhumÃ²Ã¡, resulting in stillness. The Vedic \\ntexts or scriptures suggest that the best way for \\nthis to occur is through the practice of meditation, \\nas instructed by a true guru. Four initial stages of \\nmental development exist. The mind,\\n1) Is stuck in dullness, greed, and violence\\n(tamas).\\n2) Seeks excess chatter or activity, or it seeks \\nempty fame and fortune (tamas and rajas).\\n3) Becomes conscientious, and wants knowl -\\nedge, piety, and prosperity; realizing there is more \\nto life than material possessions (rajas).\\n4) Becomes pure, kind, compassionate, clear, \\nand happy. No trace of rajas exists (only sattwa \\nexists). This fourth or sattwic state is the first \\nstage of samÃ¡dhi or peace. The quiet mind is now \\nready to hear the inner eternal calling. This eter -\\nnal experience is even more alluring than hap -\\npiness gained sensory pleasure. Then, the mind \\nundergoes two more stages of the development of \\nhigher consciousness. The mind,\\n5) Becomes drawn towards the inner Divine at -\\ntraction and becomes absorbed in eternal bliss. \\nNo awareness of thoughts of the outer world exist    \\n(second stage of samÃ¡dhi).\\n5a) After this second stage of samÃ¡dhi, oneâs \\nawareness returns (i.e., getting up from medita -\\ntion), but some of that inner peacefulness re -\\nmains. This peace develops as one continues to \\nmeditate.\\n6) Full Self-Realization. This occurs when the \\nsecond stage of samÃ¡dhi remains, even when one \\nis out of meditation. In this final stage of samÃ¡dhi \\none sees the inner Self as Divine and eternal, and \\nall people and things in life as that same Divine \\nSelf. One feels full compassion, peace, and eternal \\nbliss. Activities and objects of the outer world no \\nlonger affect this eternal peace. One becomes the peace. Everything has become the peace. Thus, \\nthere is nothing that is ânon-peaceâ. The relative \\nworkings of the mind are fully stopped, and the \\nlife-breath flows permanently and quietly through \\nthe entire suÃhumÃ²Ã¡.\\nPrÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma means stilling of the breath. Inha -\\nlation, exhalation, and breath retention, condition \\nthe breath to be still. Stillness of breath stills the \\nmind. PrÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma cleanses the channels (nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­s) \\nand energy centers (chakras), just as a broom or \\nvacuum clears the dirt from a house. Speaking in \\nmodern scientific terms, the breathing process is \\nintimately linked to the brain and central nervous \\nsystem. It is also related to the hypothalamus, \\nwhich involves the emotions, body temperature, \\nmemory, and perceptions. Erratic thinking of the \\nhypothalamus also leads to erratic breathing and \\neventually to asthma. So, a quiet breath keeps the \\nbody healthy and the mind at peace.\\nPrÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma is related to the in and out breaths \\nof the nose. Certain areas of the noseâs mucus \\nmembrane are connected to the visceral organs \\n(i.e., thorax, abdomen, heart, lungs, kidneys, and \\nintestines). According to yogic thinking, when \\nthis nasal breathing becomes irregular, the viscer -\\nal organs connected to the coccygeal plexus also \\nbecome irregular. In turn, they send sporadic mes -\\nsages to the brain, causing further irregularities. \\nWhen the breath is held, it allows for a longer as -\\nsimilation time of the prÃ¡Ã²a. The result is the ex -\\nchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the cells. \\nThus, the breath is intimately linked to physical \\nand mental health.\\nThroughout yogic literature it is written that \\nthose who use fewer breaths will live longer. So, \\nlearning how to make the breath automatically \\nstop, helps foster longevity. Spiritually, this stop -\\npage of breath (i.e., the stopping of oneâs mind), \\nallows one to delve more deeply into oneâs inner \\nSelf of peace, alertness, and harmony.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

As they are cleansed, oneâs spir -\\nitual life-force is allowed to flow higher, develop -\\ning or utilizing the benefits of the higher chakras. \\nAs one is able to live with their higher chakras \\nopened, life becomes more peaceful, graceful, \\nand Divine.\\nYet, the nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­s and chakras must be cleansed gen -\\ntly and naturally; so that the suddenâand possi -\\nbly harmful life-forceâwill not flow through the \\nchannels before they are ready. A clay pot must \\nbe baked in an oven to hold water properly; if it is \\nnot properly prepared, it will quickly disintegrate. \\nLike the clay pot, the nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­s and chakras must be \\nprepared to accept the flow of the life-force or \\nthey too will disintegrate. Medically speaking, prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m strengthens the sympathetic, parasym -\\npathetic, and the central nervous systems to ac -\\ncept the charge of life energy.\\nSo, prÃ¡Ã²a is valuable from both the medical \\nand spiritual viewpoints. Two ways of inducing \\nprÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma exist: automatic or manual. The Rig \\nVeda Bhasyabhumika, an ancient Vedic scripture, \\nsays that through proper sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation), \\nprÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma occurs on its own, cleansing what is \\nneededâwhen it is needed. The Vedic scriptures \\ncaution persons from trying to open their chakras \\non their own, for such an opening can cause great \\ndamage physically, psychologically, and spiritu -\\nally.\\nPrÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma/Kumbhaka\\nThrough prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m breathing exercises, one \\nmanually stimulates the prÃ¡Ã²a flow. Not only can \\nthis be dangerous without proper instruction, but \\nit can also be considered unnecessary if one prac -\\ntices proper sÃ¡dhanÃ¡.

Persons should not eat at all for at least 1 \\nhour before this practice. Foods should be based \\non oneâs Ãyurvedic constitution.\\nGeneral Benefits:  Besides those benefits discussed \\nearlier, prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m also removes hiccups, cough, \\nheadache (and migraine), eye and ear pains, re -\\nspiratory and digestive problems (i.e., asthma, \\nwheezing, indigestion, hyperacidity), mucus, fat, \\nobesity. It helps with all diseases caused by the \\nthree doÃ¤has.\\nDiscussed in the Vedic scripture, the YogaÂ¤hikÃ¡ \\nUpaniÃ¤had, is a four-stage process of Yoga or \\nSelf-Realization: Mantra, HaÃ³ha (and prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ -\\nma), Laya, and Raja. All stages develop or refine \\nthe breathing process until it ceases to flow. This \\nis the goal of breathing exercises.\\nAfter one begins a natural form of mantra \\nsÃ¡dhanÃ¡ (meditation), haÃ³ha yoga begins auto -\\nmatically. PrÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma is related to haÃ³ha. HaÃ³ha \\nmeans the unification of the upper and lower \\nvital breaths of the body. By uniting the breath \\nthat flows through the thousands of channels, the \\nbreaths merge into the suÃhumÃ²Ã¡, or spiritual tube \\n(inside the spine).\\nAs previously discussed, the result of this uni -\\nfication is the stilling of the breath. The ceasing \\nof inhalation and exhalation occurs spontane -\\nously during the Laya stage of yoga. Here one is absorbed in their inner eternal, Divine Self. The \\nsenses do not perceive any outside objects or \\nthoughts. This creates a great peace in the spirit \\nthat, healthwise, brings much mental and physical \\nhealing, alertness and calm.\\nEventually this stillness of breath becomes \\npermanent. This is called the final stage, or Raja \\nYoga, when a person remains permanently cen -\\ntered inside themselves.

They are frictionless, so \\nthey are called unstruck. The Vedic scripture, \\nHaÂ´sopanishad, says there are 10 different forms \\nof AnahÃ¡ta NÃ¡da. These are the unstruck sounds \\nof the eternal, Divine. \\nThrough tracing them back to their source (the \\neternal), one begins to see the unification of all \\naspects of life, self, and environment as one inte -\\ngrated whole or eternal reality. That is, all sounds \\nare subtler or grosser vibrations of eternity. The \\nVedic text, YogaÂ¤hikhopanishad, says there is \\nnothing (i.e., no mantra or incantation) that is su -\\nperior to nÃ¡da, through which some obtain full \\nSelf-Realization.\\nIn the book Yoga Vani, four stages of nÃ¡da are \\ndiscussed:\\n1. ParÃ¡: NÃ¡da evolves out of the kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ life-\\nforce at the mÃºlÃ¡dhÃ¡ra (first chakra), like a seed \\nor a dot.\\n2. PaÂ¤hyanti:  Only the most highly advanced \\nspiritual adepts (yogis) can hear nÃ¡da at this \\nstage. When one neither hears sounds nor feels \\nwith their ears, but hears sounds intuitively.\\n3. Madhyama:  When nÃ¡da rises to the heart, it \\nsounds like the rumbling of thunder. It is felt by \\nthe ears, but not heard; this is called madhyama. \\n4. Baikhari:  When sound rises to the throat it \\nproduces voice or sound. NÃ¡da heard by the ears \\nis called baikhari.\\nAll language comes from nÃ¡da. Thus, all sounds \\nand language are grosser expressions of the life-\\nforce. NÃ¡da, in turn is a subtle expression of the \\neternal, Divine. When one hears the unstruck \\nsound, they are hearing the eternal itself.\\nHere was discussed nÃ¡da as it is developed \\nthrough mantras guided by gurus. When a guru \\nis not available one can use mantras for specific \\ntherapies; these are detailed in Chapter 10.Part 3   MudrÃ¡s & Bandhas\\nMudrÃ¡s are specific body and hand positions \\nthat channel the energy created by Ã¡sanas and \\nprÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m into the chakras and suÃhumÃ²Ã¡; they \\nstimulate higher mental functioning. Some mu-\\ndrÃ¡s are done with the Ã¡sanas and prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m, \\nwhile others are done after these first two practic -\\nes. As said earlier, merely by practicing sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ \\n(meditation) instructed by a true guru, Ã¡sana, \\nprÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m, and mudrÃ¡ occur spontaneously. How -\\never, for those who are interested, the specific ex -\\nercises may be practiced separately. Various mu-\\ndrÃ¡s can be seen in performances by traditional \\nIndian dancers.\\nNote that practicing these exercises can create \\nproblems if not taught or performed properly. \\nThose who awaken their kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ without a guru \\ncan lose their direction in life. Without the knowl -\\nedge of harmonizing or using these energies, they \\ncan become confused or mentally imbalanced. If \\nthe kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ rises through the iÃ¦Ã¡ or piÂ´galÃ¡, in-\\nstead of the suÃhumÃ²Ã¡, or if chakras are opened \\nin an isolated manner, more harm than good can \\narise. Thus, yoga (haÃ³ha, kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­, and tantra) \\nneed to be taught in a holistic or integrated man -\\nner.\\nSome mudrÃ¡s and bandhas have briefly been \\ndiscussed in part 1. Here, these same positions \\nwill be discussed without Ã¡sanas. Twenty-five \\nmajor mudrÃ¡s (and bandhas) are discussed in Gh-\\neranda SaÃ¥hitÃ¡, and 10 in HaÃ³ha Yoga PradÃ­pikÃ¡. \\nThese create longevity and reverse the aging pro -\\ncess. Nine methods are outlined below.\\nPreparatory Bandhas\\nOne first needs to learn three locks that are in -\\ncluded in the mudrÃ¡ positions. These have been \\ndiscussed as automatic occurrences in various \\nÃ¡sanas in section 1 of this chapter.

This is \\nknown as a stomach lift. Here, the ApÃ¡n (down -\\nward moving air) is united with the PrÃ¡Ã² (outward \\nmoving air) and the SamÃ¡n (equal moving air) at \\nthe navel center.

It \\nmay be done sitting, standing, or lying flat on the \\nback.\\nIt may be practiced with Ã¡sanas, prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡ma, or \\nafterwards.

Back, shoulder, and neck pain occur \\nfrom carrying extra weight; abdominal muscles \\nbecome stretched and unused, and leg muscles \\nstiffen and swell. Ãsanas help tone the body and keep it in shape and make the carrying time, labor, \\nand recovery easier.\\nAlthough many Ã¡sanas are not recommended \\nfor the pregnant woman, various simple positions \\ncan help counteract the adverse physical effects \\nof carrying a baby. Gentle yoga is often as impor -\\ntant as strenuous yoga. The cervix should remain \\ntight, and those with histories of miscarriages \\nor cervical insufficiencies should take extra care \\nwhen practicing Ã¡sanas. For nausea, fatigue, or \\ndizziness, Ãyurvedic herbs are available to bal -\\nance these conditions (see Section 3, Chapter 23). \\nPractice can last from 10 to 20 minutes daily, with \\nrest after each posture.\\nThis section is laid out in two parts, Ã¡sanas \\nthat can be done throughout the pregnancy; and \\nÃ¡sanas that can be done after delivery. The poses \\nare arranged in an easily followed order.\\n  \\n \\nPrecautions:  Do not perform any postures that \\nchair and kneel on require lying on the stomach, \\nthat overly stretch pillow. Lift the right the ab -\\ndominal muscles,  or that only twist from  the rib \\ncage up. Always bend from the hips (not the back). \\nKeep the pelvis upright and the spine straight.\\nAfter the fourth month, practice only sitting  ly -\\ning-on-the-side postures. As with all practices,  \\nways listen to your body. Do not hold any postres \\nthat cannot be practiced comfortably.

Beginning \\nÃ¡sanas during childhood will \\nhelp maintain health and flexibility during adult \\nand later years. The open spiritedness of children \\nmakes them naturally curious to try Ã¡sanas. Often \\nthey will want to follow along as parents practice \\ntheir Ã¡sanas. With a little encouragement and ed -\\nucation of physical, mental, and spiritual health, \\nchildren will quickly take to the postures. Explain \\nthe benefits of Ã¡sana in terms they can understand, \\naccording to their age (teenagers can be told of \\nthe reduction of acne, improved concentration, \\nand memory, etc.). Parents can help their young -\\nsters attain these postures, making sure they do \\nnot strain or hurt themselves.\\nTo make the childâs Ã¡sana time more fun, par -\\nents can do two things. First, keep the sessions \\nshort, allowing for the childâs attention span. \\nSecond, suggest that they pretend to be different \\nanimals, and give them the animal names of the \\nÃ¡sanas (e.g., lion, snake, cat, etc.). They can also \\npretend to be objectsâe.g., the bridge.\\nPrÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yama breathing exercises are also good \\nfor children to learn. As they learn to breathe dur -\\ning the Ã¡sanas, they will see how to take breaths \\nfrom the lower abdominal cavity, rather than the \\nchest.\\nVarious forms of meditation can be introduced \\nas well. Children can begin to understand that \\nmeditation means anything that makes the mind \\nquiet and relaxed. Sunrises and sunsets, nature \\nwalks, and thinking of God are all helpful. If chil -\\ndren understand the importance of setting aside a \\nquiet time each day and making this a daily habit, \\nthey will retain this habit throughout their teenage \\nand adult years.\\nEthics and virtue are important principles that \\nensure sound health and longevity. If parents in -\\nculcate and exemplify these principles in daily \\nlife, children will better understand them and see \\nthese ideals in action.\\nLastly, proper Ãyurvedic diet, using herbs and \\nincorporating aroma and color therapies, will \\nround out the healing and balancing of the five \\nsenses. So Ã¡sanas, prÃ¡Ã²Ã¡yÃ¡m, meditation, ethics, \\nand Ãyurvedic life habits are the keys to a healthy \\nchildhood, and the foundations of a healthy and \\nbalanced adulthood.\\nPart 7\\nYoga for the Office\\n \\nUnless a company has an \\nexercise room, finding ad -\\nequate space and acceptance \\nfor practicing yoga Ã¡sanas at work is unlikely. \\nYet, when stress becomes problematic, some stretching can be done surreptitiously.\\n  \\n     To increase the sense of relaxation, aromather -\\napy can also be used. Place essential oils on the \\nthird eye or under the nose, or put a drop of oil on \\na light bulb to let the aroma mildly permeate the \\nroom (e.g., sandalwood for stress, frankincense \\nfor alertness). Aromas or fragrant flowers balance \\noneâs Ãyurvedic mental constitution. The office \\ncan also host negative ion-producing herbs and \\nplants (e.g., basil, corn plants, etc.). They promote \\nclarity and freshen the air. Color therapy may also \\nbe used. Colors also balance oneâs emotional con -\\nstitution. Paintings, rugs, flowers, wall paint, or \\nother small items harmonize oneâs emotions.\\nBelow are eight modified Ã¡sanas that can be \\npracticedâwithout being noticedâin the office. \\nCorrect posture is always helpful.

The Ve-\\ndas state that creation arises from the first sound \\nof the universe, the primordial sound Aum. The \\ndefinition of mantra varies because there are so \\nmany types of mantras: Ãyurvedic, astrological, \\ndeities, seed (bÃ­ja) mantras, and the like. Many \\nbooks about mantras exist as well. A special group \\nof mantras are Guru mantras. These are words \\nenlivened by the spiritual teacher to awaken our \\ninner kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ Â¤hakti and develop our spiritual \\ngrowth of Self-Realization. Different Gurus use \\ndifferent mantras; some use meaningless sounds, \\nsome use musical sounds, some use the mantra \\naum, aum namaÃ  Â£ivaya, haÂ´g saÃ ; and others \\nuse name-symbol or deity mantras. It is believed \\nthat any words the Guru speaks to a person are \\nmantras or awakeners of kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­. If the Guru \\nsays, âeat an apple,â that would be a mantra for \\nthat moment. Some gurus use only the playing of \\nmusic to realize the Divine. Some meditate on the \\nDivine as unmanifest, formless.\\nSound itself belongs to the element of ether, the \\norigin of all the other elements. By calming and \\nawakening the inner self through sound, a person \\ncan calm, harmonize, and balance all the elements \\nthat are in his or her life.\\n\\uf05c\\t(âAUMâ, THE 1ST SOUND OF THE UNIVERSE)Guru Mantras\\nMantra is that which saves us from the workings \\nof the mind.

Thus, the mantra \\nis nothing but the breath of life.\\nThis life-breath, when exhaled, makes the sound \\nâHang, â and when inhaled, makes the sound âSahâ. \\nThis mantra occurs in all creatures 21,600 times \\ndaily over the entire 24 hour period.

Yogis perceive this sound as a sprout from \\nan invisible seed. As it moves to the navel, it can \\nyogically be perceived as visible rumbling, as if \\nfrom the clouds.

Otherwise, \\neveryone could refer to a book or go to a religious \\nservice and feel the awakening of life within. \\nSome rare individuals, who have developed much \\nspiritual sincerity and earnestness, can enliven \\nmantras for themselves, but this is rare.\\nIn the book Yoga Vani there is a discussion of \\nthe benefits of name-symbol mantras. The impor -\\ntance of the mantra is the deity established by it. \\nMantra is the attribute and deity is the goal. Just \\nas the term âsunâ and its effulgence have a rela -\\ntionship, so the mantra and its deity have a con -\\nnection. Mantra and its deity meditation, bring \\nconcentration through meditation, and the result \\nis that the deity is revealed in the Soul.\\nAwakening KuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­\\nLike a double-tongued snake, kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ (the \\nessential life force) has two mouths: internal \\nand external. One mouth is stuck in the internal \\nsuÃhumÃ²Ã¡ (a spiritual tube, running up the spine) \\nthat leads to Self-Realization. The other mouth \\nis open to the external passage. This is why we \\nare aware of the world and why we breathe; and \\nthis is why we see the diversity of life. When, \\nthrough the grace of a Guru, the kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ is \\nawakened, it may appear as a flash of lightning. \\nOnce awakened, the kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ gradually rises up \\nthe suÃhumÃ²Ã¡. It cleanses karmic sludge out of \\nthe spine and the chakras, just as a hot iron rod \\ncleanses the dirt from a hookah pipe tube. Persons \\nmay have experienced quivering, shaking move -\\nments of the body, or suspension of breath during \\nmeditation. This is the experience of the kuÃ²Ã¦alinÃ­ \\nÂ¤hakti cleansing the inner tube and chakras.  \\nÃyurvedic Healing Mantras\\nHealing sounds balance both the mind and \\nbody, as well as the spirit. Practitioners find that \\nimparting Ãyurvedic mantras helps heal their cli -\\nents. Mantras also help balance prÃ¡Ã²a, tejas, and \\nojas. They help harmonize nerve tissue, and they \\nclear subtle impurities from the nerves and nÃ¡Ã¦Ã­s \\n(subtle channels). These mantras also aid oneâs \\nconcentration and creative thinking.\\nBoth practitioner and client use the mantras \\nduring a session. They empower all actions on a \\nsubtle level, infusing the cosmic life force into the \\nhealing process. Generally, VÃ¡yu doÃhas mentally \\nrepeat mantras, while Pitta and Kapha doÃhas \\nmay also chant them. Kaphas do particularly well \\nwith chanting; it is suggested that they do so on a \\ndaily basis.\\nAum: (long âahhâ, then âumâ as in home) \\nMost important, for it represents the Divine \\nword, serving to energize or empower all things \\nand processes.

For example, when \\nthe life-breath flows through the optic nerves in \\nthe eye, it has the function (energy) of vision. \\nIf the flow of life-breath is blocked, sight is im -\\npaired. Thus, the various sense organs are infused \\nby the one life-breath.\\nWhen the life-breath, which is drawn in differ -\\nent directions through the different channels, is \\ndirected by yoga or union (devotional SÃ¡dhanÃ¡) \\nto flow through the suÃhumÃ²Ã¡â or spiritual tube \\nwithin the spine, Pure Knowledge is developed \\nand one gains Self-Realization. All the other chan -\\nnels are for enjoyment. Deep inside the suÃhumÃ²Ã¡ \\nlie the chakras (energy centers). They are visible \\nonly through the spiritual eye.\\nSome say there are 350,000 channels, some say \\n72,000 channels.

In short, mu -\\nsic was a path for the musically inclined to reach \\nGod. The music teacher was the guru. By follow -\\ning the guruâs musical instruction, the student or \\ndisciple also learned a spiritual lesson. The musi -\\ncal path towards Self-Realization was one lack -\\ning intellectual analysis or discussion. Merely \\nby playing music, one would gradually merge \\nwith the eternal Divinity. The basic learning pre -\\ncept was, âÂ¤hikÃha, dÃ­kÃha, parÃ­kÃhaâ: learning, \\ndedicated practice, evaluation. Below is a dis -\\ncussion of classical North Indian music. \\n  \\n     The traditional learning method was to live \\nnear the guruâs home and spend each day in the -\\nory, vocal music classes, and so forth. Like all \\nforms of Vedic learning, originally the teaching \\nof music was an oral tradition, passed on from \\nteacher to student. The teacher was always there \\nto correct the studentâs performance or under -\\nstanding of the music (rags âa melody base or \\nform over which the musician may improvise). \\nStudents practiced small sections of the mu -\\nsic until they gradually learned the entire song.  \\n     Today, unless one lives in India, finding such a \\nteacher with whom to study is difficult.

Colors \\nare absorbed primarily through the eyes or Alo-\\nchak Pitta (and secondarily through the skin or \\nBhrÃ¡jak Pitta). It is a crucial part of subtle mental \\nand prÃ¡Ã²ic life-force nutrition as it energizes the \\nnerves (which stimulate the mind). Besides ab -\\nsorbing colors, the mind and body produce them \\nas well, adding the powers of digestion.\\nTejas:  Mental fire, or tejas, is the major realm \\nthat color therapy affects most. Bright colors in -\\ncrease tejas, and dark colors diminish it. Howev -\\ner, if colors are too bright, tejas becomes burnt out \\n(psychedelic drugs have this affect also), and dis -\\nharmonious or clashing colors derange tejas. So \\ntejas can be balanced by the right use of colors. \\nTo increase tejas, one meditates on a ghee flame \\nor golden light. White or deep blue color reduces \\nexcess tejas, and green balances it.\\nJust as the choice of foods either balances or \\nderanges the bodyâs health, oneâs choice of colors \\nacts similarly. Colors provide emotional strength \\nand creativity. If misused, colors can cause a dis -\\nturbance or depression (i.e., bright colors stimu -\\nlate emotions and energy, dark colors suppress \\nemotions and reduce energyâalthough they can \\nalso calm certain individuals). Healing psycho -\\nlogical diseases is greatly assisted through color \\ntherapy.\\nPhysically, color stimulates digestion, circula -\\ntion, improves vitality, increases overall physical activity, and most of all, energizes blood\\n(Ranjak Pitta). However, if colors inappropriate \\nfor the constitution are used, they weaken the cir -\\nculation, depress the appetite, increase toxins in \\nthe blood, or cause mental hyperactivity. Colors \\nact like gems; they strengthen the aura and astral \\nbody. This is the realm of pure color, and is suit -\\nable for subtle or spiritual healing.\\nApplied Color Therapy\\nThe use of colors in oneâs daily life adds psy -\\nchological harmony and peace of mind. Below are \\nvarious methods of how color therapy is used.\\nSince color is so important,\\n-Use colored lamps, either by placing colored \\nglass over light bulbs or by buying colored bulbs.\\n-Use soft lights instead of fluorescent or neon. \\n-Use full-spectrum lights in the winter (when \\nthere is less sunlight) to alleviate depression. \\n-Use mild and harmonious shades. \\n \\n-Bathe the whole body or specific parts with \\nvarious colored lights. For example, use dark  \\nblue light for inflammation, infection, or rheuma -\\ntoid arthritis on the hands (use smaller bulbs  for \\napplication on specific sites). \\n \\n-Choose the colors of your surroundingsâ  \\nclothes, home furnishings, car, office, bedroomâwith care.\\n \\n-Note exposure to colors in nature: sky blue, \\nocean blue/green/ turquoise, white snow or moon -\\nlight, plush green trees, shrubs and grass; colorful \\nflowers; meditate on colorful flowers such as a \\nwhite lily, red rose or hibiscus, yellow     chrysan -', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

They cause the mind \\nand senses to become heavy, inert, and congested. Tamasic colors are brown, black, and gray.\\nWhite and black are not really considered col -\\nors, but the polar opposites of light and dark, from \\nwhich color is produced.

It \\nis known that planets produce effects in humans. \\nFor example, the full moon not only causes high \\ntides, but also affects the emotions of some peo -\\nple. The gemstones were studied and used to neu -\\ntralize these effects.\\nThe ancient Ãyurvedic researchers studied heal -\\ning properties of gems, and found that different \\nstones created different effects in the human body. \\nThe planets were seen to have corresponding col -\\nors. The color or vibration of the gems affects the \\nhuman body. They absorb and reflect (like a fil -\\nter) the planetary rays or vibrations. Thus, gems \\nrelate to specific energy waves. It was found that \\nthe gems associated with each planet have vary -\\ning wave lengths.\\nThe planetary vibrations are negative, while the \\nradiation of the stones is positive. When the posi -\\ntive and negative vibrations are combined, they \\nare neutralized. Just as an umbrella or sun screen \\nprotects one from the sun, so gems protect one \\nfrom the influence of the planets.\\nIn ancient Vedic texts, like the Brihat SamhitÃ¡, \\nthe origin and healing powers of various gems are \\ndiscussed. Persons may use substitute stones in -\\nstead of the more expensive gems.

Curved U-\\nshaped metal strips or spoons are used. Scraping \\nremoves obstructions in respiration. By scraping \\nthe whole tongue, one releases repressed emo -\\ntions.

If inad -\\nequate amounts of food are eaten, the agni fire \\nwill burn up the bodyâs plasma (rasa), vitiating \\nVÃ¡yu. Cane sugar, rice, oils, hot water, and milk \\nproducts promote longevity, when taken during \\nthis season. Raw honey, sour, and salty tastes are \\nalso suggested.

There are three levels of exercise: \\npassive (e.g., massage), active (e.g., walking, ski -\\ning), and energy-balancing (e.g., yoga, Tai Chi). \\nYet, to prevent insufficient or excessive exercise, \\nÃyurveda stresses an individual approach to exer -\\ncise for each doÃha .\\nIn the 1980âs there was a popular saying, âno \\npain, no gain.â However, this is only true for Ka -\\npha doÃhas. For VÃ¡yu and Pitta constitutions, the \\nsaying is, âNo pain, no pain.â That is, exercise \\nuntil one begins to perspire, then stop. Excess ex -\\nercise will hurt and dehydrate VÃ¡yu doÃhas, and \\nit will overheat Pitta doÃhas. On the other hand, \\nKapha persons need a very active routine and \\nare strongly advised to exercise a little past the \\npoint of fatigue. This improves mental alertness, \\ndigestion, and weight control. Professional and semi-professional athletes, and those who are on \\na program to build up their endurance, will need \\nto perspire and feel some fatigue.

Active sports include walking (the best exer -\\ncise), jumping on a trampoline, swimming, danc -\\ning, and cross-country skiing. To prevent drying \\nout, it is best that VÃ¡yu doÃhas oil their bodies as a \\nwarm-up. Yoga or stretching is also advised before \\nand after exercising. Drinking VÃ¡yu-reducing tea \\nbefore exercise also prevents dehydration. VÃ¡yu \\ndoÃhas tend to have joint and arthritic problems, \\nso oil massage, stretching, and exercises that nei -\\nther stress nor have high impact on the joints are \\nuseful.

People, ani -\\nmals, and nature are all a part of the same web of \\nlife; touch one area of the web and the whole web \\nis affected. To help oneself, one must help oth -\\ners. As the realization of the interconnectedness \\nor unboundedness of oneâs inner Divinity grows, \\nthe view of separateness between the inner and \\nouter world diminishes. One begins to see that \\neveryone and everything is a part of the same Di -\\nvine essence. Conversely, when things are seen as \\nseparate from the Self, one longs for that which \\nis believed to be other than the Self. This longing \\ncauses grief or suffering. However, as Self-Real -\\nization grows and one begins to see all things (i.e., \\nthemselves and others) as a part of the same Divine \\nessence, then longing, grief, and suffering dimin -\\nish. One begins to feel content because nothing is \\nseparate from themselves. Further, since the Self \\nand others are seen as Divine, then the feelings of \\nDivinity (i.e., eternal grace and bliss) replace the \\npreviously felt negative emotions and thoughts.\\nAnother important way to develop this holy ex -\\nperience is by following oneâs dharma  (oneâs life \\npath or purpose; using oneâs innate or God-given \\ntalents). Working in a career one loves is another \\ndefinition of following oneâs dharma.  When per -\\nsons work at something they love, it ceases to feel \\nlike work. When one uses their God-given talent, \\nit creates a stronger connection between them -\\nselves and the Divine. Persons feel they are doing \\nsomething meaningful and useful; life feels more \\npurposeful.\\nFollowing oneâs dharma is not only uplifting for \\nthe individual, but by definition, is also beneficial \\nfor others. Thus, each doÃha begins to find a more \\npositive social outlook.\\nVÃ¡yu : The idea that the world is a harsh, un -\\nsupportive, clashing, chaotic, and unadjustable is \\nreversed.\\nPitta: Their idea that the world is a place to gain \\npower and recognition is changed to a more har -\\nmonious and integrated view.Kapha : A sense of greed and their need for outer \\nsecurity, clinging, and accumulation of material \\nthings is reversed.\\nÃyurveda and Counseling\\nThe ancient Ãyurvedic texts were replete with \\ninformation on how to live a healthy balanced \\nlife:\\nLifestyle considerations based on physical \\nconstitution.\\nLifestyle considerations based on mental or \\nemotional constitution.\\nPsychological insights discuss personal, spiri -\\ntual, career, relationship, and environmental \\nissues.\\nMaintenance, prevention, and longevity.\\nCharak SaÃ¥hitÃ¡  says that the practitioner who \\nhas even a basic knowledge of Ãyurveda and \\npractices out of love and caring for others will be \\na better practitioner than one who knows every -\\nthing about the topic, yet is more concerned with \\nfame and fortune.

(Conversely, \\nthese ancient scriptures advise that the client also \\nbe respectful of the practitioner.)\\nPractitioners are advised not to become too inti -\\nmate with clients (i.e., they should maintain a pro -\\nfessional relationship), or else clients may begin \\nto view the practitioner as a friend.

Clients \\nmust also feel their personal and spiritual life will \\nbe respected, knowing that consultations will be \\nkept confidential.\\nDoÃha Personalities\\nThe Charak SaÃ¥hitÃ¡  notes that each doÃha has \\na different personality; therefore, each doÃha  re-\\nquires a unique behavioral approach.\\nVÃ¡yu : They are more fearful, and appear ner -\\nvous, upset, or distracted. These doÃhas may feel \\nhesitant, insecure, fidgety, unsettled, or doubtful \\nabout themselves or the therapy. Conversely, they \\nmay be overly enthusiastic and excited, expect -\\ning too much with no real motivation behind it. \\nThey tend to be ungrounded and hard to deal with \\n(i.e., they need to have an âintoâ body experience). \\nThese people may feel negative and worried about \\nthemselves and their condition, imagining things \\nare worse than they really are (i.e., hypochon -\\ndria).\\nTherapy : The practitioner attempts to get them \\nto be more realistic about their situation and \\nhow to correct it; they need to bring them down \\nto earth. They need to be treated delicately, like \\nflowers. VÃ¡yu doÃhas responsibly start their pro -\\ngrams, then begin to slack off after a while.\\nPitta : They think they know who they are and \\nwhat they are doing. Probably, they will tell the \\npractitioner what they should do for them. These \\npeople will analyze themselves and try to take \\nover the consultation. They may have a critical, aggressive, or quarrelsome nature, asking for cre -\\ndentials or questioning the reliability of Ãyurveda \\nitself. Because they enjoy authority status and hi -\\nerarchy, the practitioner needs to respond simply \\nand objectively. This doÃha  may expect the prac -\\ntitioner to heal them. They may judge the practi -\\ntionerâs qualifications or want the practitioner to \\ntell them how they will be healed. However, the \\npractitioner is advised not to be dragged into such \\ngame-playing. In short, the more practitioners \\ntry to justify themselves, the more the Pitta doÃha \\nwill doubt them . If the client is not happy with the \\ncredentials, then it is just as well; because with \\nthis clientâs frame of mind, the therapy could not \\nwork.\\nTherapy : First, the practitioner is advised to re -\\nmain objective and rational, discussing the criti -\\ncal nature of the individual so they can learn to \\nunderstand it as a cause of their imbalances. This \\nprocess of awakening oneâs abilities to discrimi -\\nnate enables the client to control their lives as \\nopposed to their trying to control life; they can \\nchange from having a critical nature to a dis -\\ncriminating disposition. Pitta doÃhas need to be \\ntreated in a friendly manner . These constitutions \\nare cooled (balanced) by calm, pleasant circum -\\nstances and behavior. Only then will they feel the \\npractitioner is on their side. This doÃha  needs to \\nfeel they are seen in an authoritative light. When \\nPitta doÃhas understand what is entailed in self-\\nresponsible healing, they are very good at apply -\\ning and following the therapies. However they \\nmust be cautioned not to become fanatical in the \\napplication of therapy; to avoid burnout, the prac -\\ntitioner should urge moderation. If the therapy \\ndoes not go well, however, they are apt to become \\nangry and critical. It is best for practitioners not to \\npromise too much and to show that healing is the \\nresponsibility of the client.\\nKapha : These persons need to be motivated, \\nstimulated, or shocked into getting well. They \\nare often lethargic, slow to act, or lazy; and find \\nit hard to implement things. If left to themselves \\nthey will remain inert. They do not need comfort; \\nalthough, they may seek it.

Some people do not really want \\nto be well, as they equate their lives with their ill -\\nnesses. In this case, no one can help them heal. It \\nis usually because one wants to be sick that they \\nget sick. Being ill draws attention to themselves. \\nThe practitioner decides if a client wants help or \\nmerely attention.\\nThe first questions addressed to the client are, \\nâDo you want to be well? Do you have anything \\nto gain by staying sick? Is your illness an escape? \\nWill you spend the time needed to become well? \\nDo you want to be healed or is this just a tempo -\\nrary amusement? Are you going to take responsi -\\nbility for your health and heal yourself?

Ahimsa ânot harming, not causing trouble to \\npeople, animals or the environment, or not feeling \\nenvy. Oneâs job must be considered (i.e., this rule \\ndoesnât apply if one has a job that may require \\nkilling, like fishing or being a soldier. But even \\nfor the soldier, killing is to be only in self-defense \\nor to protect the lives of the oppressed). Those \\nwhose job doesnât involve killing are advised not \\nto kill.\\n2. Truth or saying what one means. Sincere \\nwords are meant to clarify oneâs ideas. \\n3. Non-Stealing âNot coveting other peopleâs \\npossessions; in thought, word, or action. \\n4. Brahmacharya âavoiding coition in thought, \\nword, and action is applied to single persons. Mar -\\nried couples also have a form of brahmacharya as \\ndiscussed in the Â¤hÃ¡stras . \\n5. Aparigraha , or non-acceptanceâto cease \\nfrom wanting or chasing after material wealth \\nor fame because it keeps oneâs mind attached or \\nbound (i.e., not free or at peace).\\nNiyama\\n1. Purity  (external) means pure food and clean -\\nliness. (Internal) means a pure or sattwic mind at -\\ntained through spiritual practices.\\n2. Contentedness  with what is obtained through \\nluck or the Grace of God.\\n3. Tapas , or rigor. Originally, tapas referred \\nto being able to bear extremes of heat and cold, \\nhunger, and thirst, etc. Today, many gurus  say this \\nsort of tapas is no longer needed. However, rigor \\nmay be seen in terms of personality. If a person \\noffers excessive praise (warmth) or treats one in \\na very cold manner, persons are advised to ignore \\nboth and maintain their concentration on their \\ninner Divine Self-Worth and the growth of their \\nSelf-Realization.Wisdom sacrifice (spiritual inquiry from realized \\npersons and meditation) is far superior to material \\nsacrifice (austerities).\\n  \\nBhagavad GÃ­ta Ch 4 ver 25-34\\nChapter 17 of the Bhagavad GÃ­ta defines aus -\\nterities as a threefold process involving the body, \\nspeech, and mind.\\nBody: Worship of God, holy persons, gurus, and \\nthe wise; act with purity, simplicity, continence, \\nand non-injury.\\nSpeech: That which doesnât cause harm or pain \\nto others, is true, pleasant, and beneficial; and reg -\\nular scriptural study.\\nMind: Cheerfulness, kindness, silence, self-con -\\ntrol, and purity of heart.\\n4. Study of Scriptures . Reading scriptures \\nsuch as Bhagavad GÃ­ta, Yoga VasiÃhta , and Upa-\\nniÃhads is beneficial for developing a spiritual un -\\nderstanding or framework. Practicing sÃ¡dhanÃ¡ , as \\ninstructed by oneâs guru, is actually the deepest \\nlevel of study because it is learned through direct \\nexperience within oneself.\\n5. Thinking of God as the Be-all and End-all . \\nCredit all actions to the Supreme Soul. This helps \\neliminate the desire for the consequence of action, \\n(e.g., I am not the doer, I am only the instrument. \\nGod is the doer) [of course this is not meant to be \\nused as an excuse for living irresponsibly]. Thus, \\none becomes less attached to the material world \\nand more devoted to the Divine Grace.\\nFaith\\nFaith develops Self-Worth. The highest form \\nof Self-Worth is Self-Realization: seeing that the \\nSelf is Divine. It is an essential tool that keeps \\nthe mind from developing intellectual error. Intel -\\nlectual error means to doubt oneâs true Self, and \\nresults in seeing objects as Eternal. So, faith in \\nthe growth of oneâs spiritual experiences (faith in \\nwhat one experiences through their inner eye) is \\nessential.

One may say, âI am a happy, a sad, or an \\ninfatuated person.â This creates various illusions \\nof life ( maya ). Properly stated, the reality of life \\nis, âI am eternal and unchanging. Happiness or \\nsadness is an ever-changing illusion.â\\nHairs grow of themselves, vegetables grow of \\nthemselves, so the first two bodies, the physical \\nand astral, automatically grow from the causal \\nbody.

Food Cell (Annamaya KoÃha ): The physical \\nbody is made up of food taken from the parents \\nand transformed into semen and blood. Its cell or \\nsheath hides the Soul, as a husk hides the grain. \\nThus, the Soul appears to be divided and troubled \\nby birth, life, and death, when actually it is eternal \\nâthe creator of these processes.\\n2. Life Cell (PrÃ¡Ã²maya KoÃha ): This cell in -\\nvolves the fire organs of action and the 5 life breaths. The life sheath has concealed the true na -\\nture of the passionless Soul, making it seem full \\nof passion. It makes the speechless Soul seem to \\nbe the orator and the desireless Soul seem to be \\nfull of desire.\\n3. Mind Cell (Manomaya KoÃha ): This sheath \\nincludes the 5 senses of knowledge and mind, \\nhiding the true nature of the Soul. The result is \\nthat the doubtless Soul appears as doubting, the \\nsightless Soul appears to see, the sorrowless Soul \\nseems full of sorrow, etc.\\n4. Knowledge Cell (VigÃ±anamaya KoÃha ): This \\ncell comprises the 5 senses of knowledge and the \\nintellect. It conceals the true nature of the Soul by \\nappearing as the doer or knower. It gives the Soul \\nego, action, name, fame, pride, etc.\\n5. Delight Cell (Anandamaya KoÃha ): Delight \\nconstitutes love, delight, and enjoyment, conceal -\\ning the true nature of the Soul which is beyond \\nrelative experiences of love, delight, etc. (i.e., \\nthese relative experiences have a beginning and \\nend. The Soul is a never-ending experience of \\nDivine love, etc.). This cell appears as the causal \\nbody of all beings.\\nDevotion:   \\nThe Best Ãyurvedic Medicine\\nThrough devotion or attention to the eternal Di -\\nvine state of life, one heals and prevents disease \\nand ultimately develops and attains Self-Realiza -\\ntion, the goal of Ãyurveda. For spiritual healing, a \\npersonal or devotional approach is crucial. Some \\npeople believe in K^iÃhÃ²a, some in Jesus, others \\nin Buddha, still others commune with their God \\nthrough music.

Differ -\\nent gurus teach different subjects, much as is done \\nin school. Many teach about powers, fame, and \\nfortune. However, only a rare few teach simple, \\nnatural Self-Realization. A true guru is one who, \\nat first sight, produces bliss or pleasure in a per -\\nson. Also, they will charge students no fees for \\ntraining.\\nSome people who have already been following \\na guru may feel they have learned all they can and \\nneed to move on to another guru. The Vedic  scrip -\\ntures not only validate this feeling, but suggest it \\nis necessary for the student to make the change \\nif and when the time comes. Specifically, the Ve-\\ndas state that if a student has spent at least a year \\nsincerely following a teacherâs guidance and still \\ndoes not have pleasant results, they have the right \\nand obligation to change teachers. Thus, even the \\nchoosing of oneâs guru is very much along the \\nÃyurvedic lines of taking control of oneâs health; \\nself-responsibility. Persons are cautioned against \\nblindly following teachers. The scriptures say \\nthat 3 aspects to knowing Truth exist: the words \\nof the guru, the words of the scripture, and the \\nexperiences of the pupil. Only when all 3 are cor -\\nroborated does one feel confidant that something \\nis true.\\nIn this state one embraces everyone and every -\\nthing as the same (Divine) Self. One sees all as \\nthemselves; everything inside, outside, and in \\nbetween is the same Divine eternal Self. The Di -\\nvine Self is all that exists. Then, no separation can \\nexist; no cause for wanting or longing can arise. \\nWhen longing ceases to be, no suffering or dis -\\nease can develop. Suffering only results from see -\\ning something as separate from oneself and desir -\\ning to make it yours. Sadness develops because \\none misses that from which they believe they are \\nseparated. Once this illusion is seen through, the \\ncause of suffering vanishes, just as the darkness \\ncast by a cloud disappears once the sun shines un -\\nobstructed.\\nThis is the Vedantic goal of life and the Ãy -urvedic goal as well. Thus, following oneâs per -\\nsonal spiritual path is the best Ãyurvedic medi -\\ncine.\\nWhile the importance of having a spiritual guru \\nhas been discussed, not everyone will find or de -\\nsire a guru. In this case, one is advised to listen \\nto their inner guru. The inner guru is the highest \\nguru.\\nOrigin of the Spiritual Body\\nThe Vedic  scriptures, the Srutis , discuss the spi -\\nder that produces thread from within itself. The \\nthread is woven into a web, and then withdrawn \\nback into its own body. This is said to be analo -\\ngous to the universe that is produced from Eter -\\nnal Consciousness ( Chaitanya ) and then vanish -\\nes into itself. This is the only cause of creation. \\nFurther, it is said that from a mere âglanceâ of the \\nconsciousness, its energy begins to move outward \\n(with tamas âlethargy or destructionâ as its \\nmain quality) and the sky (ether or akaÃ¤h ) is cre -\\nated. Consciousness then glances at the sky and \\nair, or VÃ¡yu is produced. Glancing at VÃ¡yu, fire \\n(tejas) is then created.

The excessed Pitta (blood or he -\\nmoglobin by-product) opens the entrances of cir -\\nculation channels. It then enters these channels \\nand mixes with the blood, circulates throughout \\nthe body, and blocks the channels. The blood and \\nPitta vitiate or aggravate each other because they \\nare both of a heating nature. As the heat increases, \\nit becomes malodorous, and begins to penetrate \\nvessel and tissue cell walls. Thus, it diminishes \\nthe clotting process and produces bleeding. The \\nliver and spleen are the origin sites of bleeding. \\nWhen Pitta is in liquid form, it is related to ranjaka \\nand pachaka (which are in the stomach, liver, and \\nspleen). Bleeding is due to Pitta associated with \\nKapha (and a little VÃ¡yu). Examples of bleeding \\ndiseases are hemophilia, purplish skin patches \\n(purpura), and an excess of red blood corpuscles \\n(polycythemia vera).\\nPremonitory or Incubatory Signs:  Heaviness \\nof head, loss of appetite or taste causing burn -\\ning sensations in the chest (which then produc -\\nes indigestion), needing cold things and feeling \\nhot, fumes coming from the stomach or mouth, \\nincreased acidity, vomiting or the fear of vomit -\\ning from seeing vomited materials, foul smell -\\ning vomit, cough, difficult breathing, dizziness, exhaustion, smelling or tasting iron, blood, and \\nraw fish; burps of sour taste and vinegary smell, \\nloss of voice, reddish, yellowish, or greenish eyes, \\nskin, nails, urine, or feces; nose, mouth, ear and \\neye excretions; pimples, body ache, indistinguish -\\nability of blue, red, and yellow colors, seeing red, \\nyellow, or blue colors in dreams.\\nFeatures:  Bleeding from the facial orifices \\n(nose, mouth, ears, eyes, throat), from the lower \\norifices (penis, urethra, vagina, genital tract, or \\nrectum), from all channels, through hair follicles \\non the skin, or simultaneously through upper and \\nlower orifices.\\nPitta is the primary doÃha causing bleeding. \\nKapha is the secondary doÃha for upper orifice \\nbleeding. VÃ¡yu is the secondary doÃha for lower \\norifice bleeding. All three doÃhas are the second -\\nary cause of simultaneous upper and lower orifice \\nbleeding.\\nWhen vitiated blood (Rakta Pitta) becomes \\nmixed with Kapha, it becomes dense, pale yellow, \\noily, and slimy. When Rakta Pitta is associated \\nwith VÃ¡yu, it becomes gray, reddish, foamy, thin, \\nand non-oily. If Rakta Pitta is further vitiated by \\nPitta, it becomes pale red and black. When two, \\nor all three doÃhas, vitiate the blood, the signs and \\nsymptoms of the respective doÃhas occur. [Gener -\\nally Pitta causes vitiated blood, but later it may mix \\nwith Kapha or VÃ¡yu to cause what is referred to as \\nKapha-caused bleeding or VÃ¡yu-caused bleeding. \\nSecondary- doÃha  rules are the same for other dis -\\neases (e.g., fevers that are mainly Pitta-caused or \\nfor tumors that are mainly VÃ¡yu-caused).

These diseases can be healed \\nthrough purgation with Pitta-relieving herbs (bit -\\ntersâe.g., musta, chirÃ¡yatÃ¡, kuÃ³ki; and astrin -\\ngentsâ maÃ±jiÃhÃ¾hÃ¡, red raspberry, turmeric) that \\nalso relieve Kapha. After Kapha has been bal -\\nanced, sweet herbs also can be used to balance \\nPitta. Upward bleeding mainly leads to associa -\\ntion with Kapha.\\nLower Bleeding\\nPlaces of lower bleeding include the rectum, \\nurethra, and genitals. These diseases are control -\\nlable through emesis and sweet, moist, VÃ¡yu-re -\\nducing herbs. Downward bleeding mainly leads \\nto association with VÃ¡yu.\\nPurgatives help reverse the direction of vomit -\\ning, whereas vomiting reverses the direction of \\nlower orifice bleeding.\\nIf bleeding is associated with only one doÃha \\nit can be healed. If two doÃhas are associated \\nwith the bleeding, it cannot be healed, but it may \\nbe controlled. Simultaneous bleeding cannot be \\nhealed because no herb or therapy can produce \\nsimultaneous healing results. TridoÃhic herbs are \\nrecommended (e.g., gokÃhura, gotu kola, guÃ¦ÃºchÃ­, \\ncoriander, bh^iÂ´garÃ¡j, triphalÃ¡). Bleeding from \\nboth directions leads to association with VÃ¡yu and \\nKapha.\\nComplications:  Mainly hoarseness, but also \\nweakness, anorexia, indigestion, difficult breath -\\ning, coughing, fever, diarrhea, edema, consump -\\ntion, and anemia can develop.Bleeding Therapies:\\nAfter determining the cause, direction (and its \\nmain and secondary doÃhas), the strength of the \\nperson and the disease, the personâs constitution, \\nseason and stage of disease, either reducing (pu -\\nrificatory) or toning (palliative) therapies are be -\\ngun.\\nWhen a strong person has mild bleedingâ pro -\\nduced by any one doÃha (without other complica -\\ntions), therapy is begun.\\nIf bleeding is caused by over nourishment and \\nthe person is strong (and their muscles are strong), \\nthen it is not advised to stop the bleeding imme -\\ndiately because the doÃhas are mixed with Ã¡ma \\nand will have a natural tendency to be eliminated. \\nPremature stoppage of bleeding can cause many \\nproblems such as throat obstructions, bad smell in \\nthe nose, fainting, anorexia, fever, benign tumors, \\nenlarged spleen, constipation, skin diseases, dif -\\nficult urination, hemorrhoids, abscesses, and poor \\ncomplexion (but if the person is weak and the \\ndoÃhas are diminished, then it is necessary to stop \\nthe bleeding).\\nFasting and Nourishing Therapies:  Since Pitta \\nand blood become aggravated due to Ã¡ma, fasting \\nis the first line of therapy. This holds true for up -\\nward bleeding, Ã¡ma, aggravated Kapha, or if hot \\nand oily factors caused the bleeding. For all other \\ncauses nourishing therapy is used.\\nThe Charak SaÃ¥hitÃ¡ (ChikitsÃ¡sthÃ¡nam Ch. 4 \\nverses 31-35) suggest the following therapies,\\nUpper Bleeding  During the earliest stage, a \\nsoothing tonic is given, boiling 12 grams of herbs \\n[date palm sugar, grape juice, bitter herbs (e.g., \\nmusta, Ã¡malakÃ­, bh^iÂ´garÃ¡j, gokÃhura, maÃ±jiÃh -\\nhÃ¡, jasmine), sandalwood and licorice] in 3.072 \\nliters (approximately 3 quarts) of water until half \\nthe water is left. It is then cooled and taken with \\ncane sugar (tarpana).\\nDownward Bleeding  In the earliest stage, rice \\nflour boiled with 11 parts water (peyÃ¡) is taken. \\nThis is a very good and time-tested remedy for \\nhemorrhagic dysentery.

Other \\ncauses include excessive naps, staying up too late, \\nunder- or overeating, exertion, fear, suppression \\nof the natural urges, or oiliness. Additional causes \\ninclude toxins in the bowels (along with fat block -\\ning any or all of the three doÃhas) that move to the \\nlegs and thighs through the blood vessels in the \\nlegs. This causes the buildup of excess fat to ham -\\nper leg coordination and restrict leg movement.\\nThis excess Kapha in the thighs causes heavi -\\nness, exhaustion, burning, pain, numbness, tear -\\ning pain, contraction, quivering, and piercing, that \\nmay even be life threatening.\\n \\nWestern medicine only sees neurological-relat -\\ned  causes such as, spinal chord injury, MS, acute \\ntransverse myelitis,  and other similar diseases \\nthat cause lesions in the spinal chord.

Further causes include improper \\noleation therapy, drinking bad water, excessive use \\nof alcohol, overdoing water sports, suppression of \\nnatural urges, hemorrhoids, intestinal parasites, \\nchanges in lifestyle, and seasonal changes. As ac -\\ncumulating VÃ¡yu becomes aggravated, it causes \\nthe Kapha (watery element) to move downward, \\ndampening the digestive fire before entering the \\nalimentary canal. This causes the feces to become \\nwatery and produce diarrhea.\\nThere are 5 types of dysentery: VÃ¡yu, Pitta, Ka -\\npha, TridoÃha, and blood (raktapitta).\\nPremonitory Signs : Prickling pain in the heart \\nregion, rectum, and alimentary tract; weak body, \\nconstipation, gas, and indigestion.Symptoms:\\nVÃ¡yu:  Watery feces, small quantity, expelled \\nwith noise, severe pain, and difficulty. It may be \\ndry, frothy, thin, rough, or scaly, slightly brown \\nand frequently expelled. Alternatively, it may \\nseem gooey, burnt, and slimy.

If the diarrhea is \\nprematurely halted while Ã¡ma is still in the body, \\nit may cause various diseases (e.g., hemorrhoids, \\nedema, anemia, tumors, fever, etc.). Rather, it is \\nadvised to allow initial Ã¡ma diarrhea to come out, \\nand even to induce it by taking harÃ­takÃ­. It is a \\npart of the bodyâs defense mechanism to expel \\ntoxins (Ã¡ma). Thus, stopping diarrhea when it is \\nstill toxic goes against the bodyâs natural healing \\nprocess.\\nPersons with a moderate doÃha excess take de -\\ncoctions to stimulate the appetite and strengthen \\nthe digestion. If doÃhas are greatly excessed, then \\nlightening therapy (i.e., paÃ±cha karma, etc.) is ad -\\nvised.\\nGeneral:  Herbs include pippalÃ­, ginger, corian -\\nder, harÃ­takÃ­, calamus, gokÃhura, bilwa, fennel.\\nVÃ¡yu:  (the same as Kapha) balÃ¡, gokÃhura, \\nbilwa, ginger, coriander, calamus, pippalÃ­, chi -\\ntrak, sour pomegranate, daÂ¤hmÃºl, Ã¡malakÃ­, ghee, \\nand rock salt are taken with foods and drinks to \\nstrengthen the digestion and the constitution.\\nPain, gas retention, and the desire to pass urine  \\nor stool (but cannot):  Are healed with bilwa, \\npippalÃ­, ginger, cane sugar, and sesame oil.\\nDiarrhea with a dry mouth (dehydration): Bas-\\nmati rice, barley soup, green lentils, sesame seeds, \\nbilwa, kuÃ¾aj, Ã­Â¤habgol fried in ghee, and sesame \\noil/added with yogurt and pomegranate, cane sug -\\nar, ginger.\\nWhen Kapha is diminished, excessed VÃ¡yu \\npresents serious problems; therefore, this condi -\\ntion must be immediately healed.\\nVÃ¡yu/Pitta:  Enemas.\\nPitta:  KuÃ³aj, chirÃ¡yatÃ¡, kaÃ³ukÃ¡, bilwa, sandal -wood, lotus seeds, ginger, pomegranate, sesame \\nseeds, mango (taken with raw honey), ghee, and \\nrice water.\\nIf the appetite is good and digestion strong, \\ngoatsâ milk will heal Pitta diarrhea.\\nIf pain recurs after cleansing, oil enemas should \\nbe administered immediately, using ghee to 1/4 \\nthe amount of sesame oil, with Â¤hatÃ¡varÃ­, bilwa, \\nand milk. If diarrhea continues, one receives a \\nmassage. Then, a pichÃ¡ basti followed by bath is \\ntaken [the soft bark of silk cotton tree and paw-\\ndar mixed with oil and ghee]. Next, persons have \\nmeals of boiled milk and Pitta-reducing foods. \\nIf one eats Pitta-increasing foods in this condi -\\ntion, it may lead to bloody diarrhea and thirst, \\npain, burning, and rectal inflammation. Should \\nthis occur, boiled goatsâ milk with raw honey and \\ncane sugar is ingested and used to wash the anus. \\nFoods include boiled rice with this milk decoc -\\ntion, and ghee. If the person is strong, food (e.g., \\nrice) should be eaten after milk is digested. Weak \\npersons eat food just after the milk. Alternately, \\nfresh butter mixed with honey and sugar is eaten \\nbefore meals. The rice is soaked in water over -\\nnight, and crushed and rubbed the next morning. \\nWhen the water from this rice is drunk, it heals \\nbloody diarrhea.\\nÃma:  Purgation is advised (i.e., see lightening \\ntherapies in paÃ±cha karma chapter) if the person \\nis strong.

This is said to \\nbe a serious illness. This cause of diarrhea differs \\nbecause of excess elimination (with or without \\nÃ¡ma) only after digestion of food. Four types of \\ngastrointestinal disorders exist: VÃ¡yu, Pitta, Ka -\\npha, and TridoÃha.\\nAir-Caused (VÃ¡taja GrahaÃ²iroga):  VÃ¡yu is in -\\ncreased by eating foods that are pungent, bitter, \\nand astringent; meals that are heavy, rough, or \\ncold; fasting, excess travel, suppression of urges, \\nexcessive sexual intercourse, or extreme mental \\nstress. This dampens the digestive fire, making di -\\ngestion difficult or variable. Thus, food becomes \\nfermented and many symptoms develop.\\nFire-Caused (Pittaja GrahaÃ²iroga):  Pitta is \\nincreased in the digestive tract by excessive eat -\\ning of foods that are pungent, uncooked, sour, \\nalkaline, and by foods that cause heartburn. This \\ninactivates the gastric enzymes (like pouring hot \\nwater over a fire; or raises agni so high it burns up \\nnutrients).\\nWater-Caused (Kaphaja GrahaÃ²iroga):  Ex-\\ncessive eating of foods that are very difficult to \\ndigest, fatty, cold; eating before the last meal is \\ndigested, and sleeping after lunch, cause Kapha \\nexcesses in digestion.\\nTridoÃha GrahaÃ²iroga:  Habits of all three \\ndoÃhas create this disorder.Symptoms:  Emaciation, heat, mouth fumes, dif -\\nficult breathing, fever, fainting, headache, food re -\\nmains stagnant in the stomach, swelling of hands \\nand feet.\\nVÃ¡yu:  Palate dryness, difficult breathing, ear \\npain, pressure or noise; constant pain in the ribs, \\nthighs, groin, and neck; simultaneous vomiting \\nand diarrhea, desire for all tastes, increased hun -\\nger and thirst, cutting rectal pain, post-digestive \\ngas, eating food brings comfort, abdominal tu -\\nmor, hemorrhoids, splenic diseases, anemia, be -\\nlieving one has heart disease, difficult elimination \\noccurs after long intervals, liquid feces are non-\\noily, thin, frothy, uncooked, cough, non-digesting \\nof foods, headaches, fainting, giddiness, stiff back \\nand waist, lower back pain, yawning, aches, thirst, \\nfever, vomiting, griping, anorexia.\\nHyperacidity causes dryness of throat, mouth, \\nthirst, blurred vision, noises, thumping or ringing \\nin the ears, pain, emaciation, debility, bad taste \\nin the mouth, insatiable appetite for food, cough, \\ndifficult breathing.\\nPitta : Food toxins, when mixed with Pitta, \\ncause bluish-yellowâor yellowâliquid feces, \\nbody odor, sour belching, burning sensations in \\nthe heart and throat areas, loss of taste, appetite, \\nand thirst.\\nKapha:  Poor digestion, vomiting, loss of taste \\nand appetite, coated mouth, expectoration, cough, \\nnausea, nasal mucus, heavy throat and abdomen, \\nbelching with bad smells and sweetness of taste, \\ndebility, loss of sexual desire, broken, uncooked, \\nheavy, mucus-filled feces; large quantity of feces, \\nweakness, and wasting (although persons are not \\nemaciated).\\nTridoÃha:  Symptoms of all doÃhas are present.\\nTo restore health, the digestive fire must be re -\\nstored.

Other causes include improper food, liq -\\nuids, and habits after paÃ±cha karma; eating very \\ndry, spoiled, or mutually adverse foods (e.g., fish \\nand milk, milk and salt, hot and cold water). Fur -\\nther causes are emaciation from splenic diseases, \\nhemorrhoids, and sprue (malabsorption, anemia, \\nand gastrointestinal disorders). \\nIgnoring diseases by continually eating and \\ndrinking harmful food and liquids, and suppress -\\ning the natural urges will also cause abdominal \\ndisorders. Weakening of the channels of circula -\\ntion, allowing undigested food toxins to remain \\nin the body, and over-nourishment can also cause \\nabdominal disorders. Other causes include the \\nconsumption of foods and liquids that irritate the \\nmind and body; obstructions caused by hemor -\\nrhoids, hair, and hard stools; intestinal ulcerations \\nor perforations; and excessive aggravation of the \\ndoÃhas. These are all related to excess Kapha and \\nVÃ¡yu; a deficiency of Pitta the and digestive fire.\\nEight forms of abdominal distention exist: VÃ¡yu, \\nPitta, Kapha, TridoÃhic, enlarged spleen (and liv -\\ner); rectum, intestines, and ascites (peritoneal).\\nPremonitory Signs:  Loss of hunger, extend -\\ned digestion time with burning, inability to tell \\nwhether food is digested (excess VÃ¡yu), steady \\nloss of strength, breathlessness after mild activ -\\nity, increase of feces quantity but difficult elimi -\\nnation, slight leg and foot swelling, joint pain on \\nthe sides of the urinary bladder, distention with \\nbursting pain (even with small quantities of easily \\ndigestible foods), with abdominal line marks and \\nloss of abdominal folds.

This causes \\nwater to accumulate between the skin, muscles, \\nand joints, thus enlarging the abdomen. This \\ncauses abdominal disorders of a VÃ¡yu, Pitta, Ka -\\npha, or TridoÃhic nature (the first four of the eight \\nforms of udara roga).\\nThere are eight types: VÃ¡yu, Pitta, Kapha, Tri -\\ndoÃha, and those caused by enlarged spleen (or \\nliver), intestinal obstruction, intestinal perfora -\\ntion, and fluid accumulation. Persons with this \\ndisease have dry palates and lips; swollen feet, \\nhands and abdomen; inactivity, loss of strength \\nand desire for food, emaciation, severe gas, and a \\ndeathly appearance.\\nVÃ¡yu:  Because of excess dry foods, insufficient \\nwater, exertion, suppression of the natural urges, \\nupward movement of air, emaciation and fasting, \\nexcess VÃ¡yu results. This excess moves through \\nthe abdominal sides, cardiac region, urinary blad -\\nder, and anus, weakening the digestion, and there -\\nby increasing Kapha (due to undigested foods). \\nKapha then blocks the movement of VÃ¡yu that \\nthen becomes stuck between the abdominal skin \\nand muscle tissues, and causes swelling. Thus, \\nVÃ¡yu is the main doÃha responsible for poor di -\\ngestion, while Kapha is a secondary factor.\\nPitta : Caused by pungent, sour, salty, very hot \\nand sharp foods, exposure to heat (fire and sun), \\neating foods that cause a burning sensation, and \\neating before the last meal is digested.

As a result, the three doÃhas slowly \\naccumulate in the alimentary tract viscera, caus -\\ning abdominal diseases.\\nEnlarged Spleen and Liver (PlÃ­ho-yakrddalu-\\ndara):  Enlarged or displaced spleen is caused by \\noverly irritating food, excess travel, strenuous ex -\\nercise, lifting heavy objects, or walking long dis -\\ntance, overindulging in sexual activity, emaciation \\ndue to excess vomiting therapies, chronic illness, \\nor excess blood (either due to an excess quantity \\nof blood, fat, or muscle tissue). The spleen hardens \\nas it becomes enlarged. When ignored, the spleen \\nputs pressure on the abdomen and pancreas, caus -\\ning this disorder. Five varieties of plÃ­ho dara ex-\\nist: VÃ¡yu, Pitta, Kapha, TridoÃhic, and blood. The \\nenlarged liver is identical to the spleen; however, \\nit happens only on the right side of the abdomen.\\nIntestinal Obstruction (Baddha-gudo-dara):\\nThis is caused by VÃ¡yu (as ruler of the rectum) \\nbecoming excessed from obstructions due to small \\nhairs (e.g., eyelashes) in food, upward moving air \\nin the abdomen, hemorrhoids, intestinal intrusion \\ninto its passage (lumen), and gas (obstructed ApÃ¡-\\nna VÃ¡yu). This excessed VÃ¡yu weakens digestive \\nand metabolic enzyme power, obstructing the \\nmovement of feces, Pitta, and Kapha, and causes \\nthis disease.\\nIntestinal Perforation (Chidro dara):  Caused \\nby sand, grass, splinters, bones, or nails in food, \\ndeep yawns, or overeating. This intestinal wound \\nbegins to ooze and the food juices reach the ex -\\nterior of the intestine. The rectum and intestine \\nbecome filled with this liquid, which causes acute \\nabdominal swelling.\\nAscites (Udako dara):  (Fluid accumulation in \\nabdominal peritoneal cavity) Poor digestion de -\\nvelops from drinking excess water after oleation \\ntherapy, being emaciated by weak digestion, or \\nworsening digestion caused by drinking excess \\nwater. From this, VÃ¡yu within the lower left stom -\\nach and the duodenum (kloman) becomes blocked by Kapha. Also, the water circulatory channel \\n(udakavaha srota) increases its water supply \\nthat obstructs the circulatory channels. Deranged \\nVÃ¡yu and Kapha further increase this water, caus -\\ning ascites.\\nSymptoms:\\nGeneral:  Sides of the abdomen are distended \\ngurgling noises, leg and hand edema, poor diges -\\ntion, smooth chin, and emaciation. One may ex -\\nperience stupor, debility, accumulation of feces, \\nurine, and sweat (especially feces); poor diges -\\ntion, burning, swelling, gas, and abdominal fluid \\nduring the most serious stages.\\nThere is slight red color with veins appearing, \\ngas and sounds, obstructions arising and subsid -\\ning in the navel region and intestines, pain in the \\nheart, waist, navel, rectum and groin, expelling \\nloud sounding gas, obstructed feces, insufficient \\nurine.\\nVÃ¡yu causes upward-moving air, pain, and gas. \\nPitta causes delusion, thirst, burning, and fever. \\nKapha causes heaviness, loss of taste and appe -\\ntite, and abdominal hardness. The liver, situated \\non the right side, when enlarged and displaced, \\ncauses abdominal swelling similar to the spleen.\\nVÃ¡yu:  Swelling of hands and feet, scrotum, and \\npain in the central and upper abdomen, ribs, waist, \\nlegs, scrotum, and back.

SamÃ¡gni digests normal \\nquantities of food without causing any difficul -\\nties; this is the ideal state of digestion.\\nIndigestion (AjÃ­rÃ²a)\\nThree kinds of indigestion exist: Ãma (Kapha-\\ncaused), vidaghda (Pitta-caused), and viÃhÃ³abdha \\n(VÃ¡yu-caused). [Some authorities suggest three \\nother forms of indigestion: RasaeÃha (indiges -\\ntion of nutrients), dinapÃ¡ka (food is digested the \\nnext day but without causing difficulty), and pra-\\ntivÃ¡sara (indigestion immediately after eating \\neach meal).\\nCauses:\\nDrinking large quantities of water, eating insuf -\\nficient or excess amounts of food at unusual times, \\neating unwholesome foods, suppression of natural \\nurges, insomnia, and daytime naps. Mental causes \\ninclude eating when angry, jealous, anxious, wor -\\nried, frightened, grieving, miserable, or in pain.\\nSymptoms:\\nGeneral: Weakness without exertion, heaviness \\nof the body, not eliminating gas and stool, giddi -\\nness, constipation, or diarrhea.\\nVÃ¡yu: Abdominal pain or distention, gas reten -\\ntion, delusion, and other VÃ¡yu symptoms.\\nPitta: Giddiness, thirst, fainting, sour and hot \\nbelchings, sweating, burning sensations (e.g., \\nheartburn), and other Pitta symptoms.\\nKapha: Abdominal and body heaviness, nausea, \\nbelching, swelling of the cheeks and eyes.\\nNutrition: Aversion to food, abdominal heavi -\\nness, extreme belchings. Pain develops whereever \\nÃ¡ma resides in the body. Many diseases can devel -\\nop because doÃhas travel in the body with Ã¡ma.\\nIndigestion is the cause of many diseases. When \\nit is healed, other diseases are healed automati -\\ncally.Complications:\\nIndigestion can lead to fainting, delirium, vom -\\niting, excessive salivation, debility, giddiness, and \\neven death. Insomnia, restlessness, tremors, sup -\\npression of urine, and fainting are the five most \\ntroubling complications. (Indigestion can cause \\nthree other diseases, visÃºchikÃ¡, alasaka, and \\nvilambikÃ¡â see below). \\nHealthy Digestion:\\nSymptoms include belchings without bad smell \\nor taste, enthusiasm, proper elimination of gas, \\nstool, and urine; lightness of the body, natural \\nhunger and thirst.\\nTherapies:\\nVÃ¡yu : Moist heat (fomentation). Herbal com -\\nbinations include triphalÃ¡, yogaraj guggul, \\nhiÂ´gwastÃ¡k chÃºrÃ²a, sitopalÃ¡di, chÃºrÃ²a, laÃhunadi \\nvaÃ³i, and lavaÃ²a bhÃ¡skar.
